pedropei@umich.edu	2	My roomate tried to kill herself and I lost my apartment to a fire. She overdosed and lit candles to pray. She realized what she did call her mom and her mom came and got her. Her mom never noticed the candles burning. It sparked a piece of paper and it fluttered up and landed on her bed. All this happened while I was at work.<SPLIT_TOKEN>Whoa, that sucks. I'm sorry that happened. I hope everything's cool now	true		true					
pedropei@umich.edu	1	Yea I shot them with my uncle on a weekly basis. Every gun in the collection i have shot a bunch, however after his passing, he willed them all to my mother. She doesn't know very much about guns in general, and isn't too keen on keeping them around considering how my uncle passed.<SPLIT_TOKEN>I'm very sorry for your mother, I hope you are all doing well. Have you considered trying to sell via r/gunsforsale as well?		true				true	true
