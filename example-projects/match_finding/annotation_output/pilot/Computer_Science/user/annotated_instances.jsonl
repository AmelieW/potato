Other key findings from the study:\n\nCharging for the first or second checked bag improved on-time departure performance for all major airlines--including Southwest Airlines, which does not charge for the first two bags--because it creates savings due to a cultural shift among US passengers to travel with less baggage. This shift resulted in a lower demand for airport labor-intensive, back-end operations such as baggage handling and security checks, which are shared resources across airlines.\">Other key findings from the study:\n\nCharging for the first or second checked bag improved on-time departure performance for all major airlines--including Southwest Airlines, which does not charge for the first two bags--because it creates savings due to a cultural shift among US passengers to travel with less baggage.</span> </div><div name=\"instance_text\" style=\"float:left;width:50%;padding:5px;\" class=\"column\"> <legend> Paper </legend> <span data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: However, charging a fee for both checked bags results in a worse on-time departure performance compared to charging for one checked bag.
