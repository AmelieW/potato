Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.", "Paper Context": "By impacting on tree growth and survival, lianas impact the carbon balance of these forests. This study is the first direct demonstration of liana effects at the ecosystem scale and illustrates the important role of lianas in tropical forests, particularly with respect to carbon budgets. Lianas are increasing in biomass and productivity throughout the tropics, and thus our findings have even greater relevance in terms of the fate of the tropical carbon balance, as well as for global atmospheric CO 2 levels, in a changing climate.", "scores": "[3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0]", "field": "Medicine", "split": "train", "final_score": 4.25, "source": "news", "News URL": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechnologyOrg/~3/PUyOGba13Ho/", "text": "REPORTED FINDING: Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more.<br>PAPER FINDING: This study is the first direct demonstration of liana effects at the ecosystem scale and illustrates the important role of lianas in tropical forests, particularly with respect to carbon budgets.", "displayed_text": "REPORTED FINDING: Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more.<br>PAPER FINDING: This study is the first direct demonstration of liana effects at the ecosystem scale and illustrates the important role of lianas in tropical forests, particularly with respect to carbon budgets."}, "Medicine_538": {"DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.aau2477", "id": "Medicine_538", "News Finding": "Almost 26 cubic kilometers of floodwater was temporarily stored on land, evaporating (or transpiring through plant leaves) much more slowly at about one cubic kilometer per day.", "Paper Finding": "Inversion of these data shows that a third of Harvey's total stormwater was captured on land (25.7 \u00b1 .0 km ), indicating that the rest drained rapidly into the ocean at a rate of 8.2 km", "News Context": "That's far more water than was captured by stations measuring river flow, showing that much of the water either did not drain through major channels or entered those channels downstream of the last measuring station.
