Moreover, we were able to quantify and show the magnitude of infrastructure at risk across the circumpolar permafrost domain. The major advantage of the approach presented here is that hazard quantification can be conducted with any available infrastructure or population dataset (also using planned infrastructure and future population if suitable high-quality datasets and projections are available) and for any policy-relevant global warming scenario.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> Moreover, we were able to quantify and show the magnitude of infrastructure at risk across the circumpolar permafrost domain.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: It shows that both myxoma (MYXV) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHDV) viruses have worked together to control feral rabbit populations in Australia during the last two decades. \"By explicitly modelling the complex way that diseases behave in rabbit populations we found an unexpected result.
