These findings suggest that the serological IgG response to human norovirus vaccination is largely dominated by the boosting of a limited number of pre-existing antibody clonotypes. These included the top most abundant clonotypes in donors A and C (A379 and C601), two strongly boosted pre-existing clones (A101 and A1431, boosted by 123 and 1263, respectively, in terms of abundance in the post-vaccination serum relative to day 0), and six emergent antibodies ( Figure 1B .\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> These findings suggest that the serological IgG response to human norovirus vaccination is largely dominated by the boosting of a limited number of pre-existing antibody clonotypes.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: For example, we found that summer drought has the strongest impact in warm and dry regions, decreased snowfall has a smaller effect in eastern compared to western North America, and winter warming is predicted to decrease species richness for all species groups except tree frogs. While we demonstrate that amphibian communities are sensitive to changes in climate, our results suggest that changing climate is not the proximate cause for ongoing assemblage-wide declines that have been observed in North American amphibians. Instead, we find that recent change in climate is a strong predictor of why local species richness is declining more quickly in some regions and that positive effects of climate may be buffering declines in other regions.\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> While we demonstrate that amphibian communities are sensitive to changes in climate, our results suggest that changing climate is not the proximate cause for ongoing assemblage-wide declines that have been observed in North American amphibians.", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"D": "4"}, "most-sensational": {"B": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 31s "}}
