Rather, we suggest that cheetah chases comprise two primary phases: (i) an initial rapid acceleration resulting in high speed to quickly catch up with prey, followed by (ii) a prey-specific slowing period that enables the cheetah to match turns instigated by prey as the distance between them closes. However, this formulation only considered forward acceleration and speed, ignoring lateral acceleration.\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Rather, we suggest that cheetah chases comprise two primary phases: (i) an initial rapid acceleration resulting in high speed to quickly catch up with prey, followed by (ii) a prey-specific slowing period that enables the cheetah to match turns instigated by prey as the distance between them closes.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: The resulting IkBa-AR2 mutants with hydrophobic AR 13 (I124I, I124L, I124F, and I124C) all bound RanGDP with high efficiency, whereas mutants with more hydrophilic residues at AR 13 , K or R, bound RanGDP with much lower efficiency ( Figure 3B ).
