The FD-CF reactions pioneered in Collins\\' lab for molecular manufacturing, when combined with innovations from the lab of Michael Jewett, Ph.D. at Northwestern University, offer a solution to this problem by removing bacteria from the equation altogether. \"Challenging the students to build their own in vitro synthetic programs also allows educators to start to talk about how synthetic biologists might control biology to make important products, such as medicines or chemicals,\" explained Jessica Stark, an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Jewett lab at Northwestern University who is co-first author on both papers.\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> The BioBits kits introduce molecular and synthetic biology concepts without the need for specialized lab equipment, at a fraction of the cost of current standard experimental designs.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: We also plan to launch a website where students can share their data and biological program designs with other users of these kits from around the world. In sum, BioBits\u2122 Bright represents a comprehensive set of educational resources for synthetic biology akin to the \"chemistry set\" that brought chemistry education to the masses and inspired generations of scientists. This is made possible by our in-house freeze-dried reactions, which are two orders of magnitude more affordable than existing commercial cell-free kits, at just ~US$0.01 per microliter of reaction volume (table S3) compared to ~US$1 per microliter (Promega L110; NEB E6800S).\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> In sum, BioBits\u2122 Bright represents a comprehensive set of educational resources for synthetic biology akin to the \"chemistry set\" that brought chemistry education to the masses and inspired generations of scientists.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: We show that the root-feeding larvae use complexes between iron and benzoxazinoid secondary metabolites to identify maize as a host, to forage within the maize root system, and to increase their growth.
