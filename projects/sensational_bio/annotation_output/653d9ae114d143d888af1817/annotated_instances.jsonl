There was no difference in resting or fasting glucose levels between the two groups, but resting insulin levels were higher in NUCKS KO mice compared with WT mice (Figures S4A and S4B ; data not shown).\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Together, these results, especially the finding that nutrient overload exacerbates the metabolic phenotypes in the absence of NUCKS, suggest that NUCKS plays a role in metabolic homeostasis in vivo.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Results did not support this prediction, nor did they support the idea that the relationship between these factors follows a nonlinear parabolic function.
