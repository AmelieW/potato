It therefore seems likely that factors other than plant invasions are the main causes of vegetation change.\" The study found that locations with high diversity of non-native species also support high diversity of native species, suggesting that high diversities of native and non-native plant species are compatible with one another.\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> It therefore seems likely that factors other than plant invasions are the main causes of vegetation change.\"<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Lianas reduce tropical forest carbon accumulation and storage.. read all about it:\\n\\n \"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Lianas reduce tropical forest carbon accumulation and storage.. read all about it:\\n\\n <br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: This staggering difference almost certainly reflects our inability to adequately mimic in vitro the environment and sperm selection mechanisms of the female reproductive tract during natural unassisted conception. Again, clearly if we knew more of the basic biology that underpins these events in vivo then there is the potential for improvements to be made to IVF procedures that could impact on the clinical outcome. Finally, diagnosis of the causes of infertility could be greatly improved if more were known of the means by which sperm travel through the female reproductive tract and the mechanisms that regulate the movement of sperm.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> Finally, diagnosis of the causes of infertility could be greatly improved if more were known of the means by which sperm travel through the female reproductive tract and the mechanisms that regulate the movement of sperm.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: In contrast, warm SSTs in the NZI region excite positive anomalies in the northwestern Pacific, deflecting the jet stream northward (at 45\u00b0-50\u00b0N), and leading to wet conditions over the northwestern US, and dry conditions in SWUS.
