Here, we demonstrate that sublethal exposure to imidacloprid, a widely used neonicotinoid-type insecticide, has a broad suite of negative effects on early-nesting bumblebee queens. These effects were observed at the level of individual queens, who were less active and exhibited greater mortality when exposed to imidacloprid, but also at the colony level, where numbers of brood in the nest were dramatically reduced in treated queens, particularly when queens experienced sustained exposure to the insecticide.\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> Here, we demonstrate that sublethal exposure to imidacloprid, a widely used neonicotinoid-type insecticide, has a broad suite of negative effects on early-nesting bumblebee queens.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Notably, the Botswanan samples differed from the Tanzanian ones.
