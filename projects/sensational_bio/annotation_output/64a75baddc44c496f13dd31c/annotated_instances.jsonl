The greatest CO 2 and FF savings from wood use are by avoiding the excess FF energy used to make steel and concrete structures (avoidance pathway). Wood products are more efficient than wood energy for CO 2 and FF savings; however, up to 37 % of the world\\'s annual CO 2 emissions and 27% of the FF use could be saved if all wood growth not used in construction were used for energy (energy pathway; Figure 6b-c) .\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> The greatest CO 2 and FF savings from wood use are by avoiding the excess FF energy used to make steel and concrete structures (avoidance pathway).<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Stepping towards universal #QuantumComputing. \\n\\nThe universal holonomic gates enable fast and fault-tolerant manipulation for realising quantum repeaters interfacing between universal quantum computers and secure communication networks. \\n\\n \"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Stepping towards universal #QuantumComputing. \\n\\nThe universal holonomic gates enable fast and fault-tolerant manipulation for realising quantum repeaters interfacing between universal quantum computers and secure communication networks. \\n\\n <br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Phenotypic traits diverge at 1.17% pMyr in the early Cambrian, w83 the average rate for the remainder of the Phanerozoic (0.139% pMyr); molecular divergence is 0.204% pMyr, w93 the subsequent rate (0.021%). This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates. The 4-and 5.5-fold increases in phenotypic and molecular evolutionary rates respectively provide quantitative support for the widespread view that evolutionary rates were elevated during the Cambrian explosion.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Nevertheless we found instances in which a single CpG within an ESC super-enhancer became hypomethylated in both female SSEA1 \u00c0 and SSEA1 + intermediates, as well as in female iPSCs, but not in female MEFs, for example bordering the miR290-295 cluster ( Figure S4B ). Our study reveals that key regulatory regions associated with the control of cell identity genes are prone to changes in DNA methylation in reprogramming intermediates in both male and female cells. Nevertheless, we found that many CpGs, particularly those in enhancer elements, which are thought to play key roles for the maintenance of cell identity , change their methylation status earlier in reprogramming.\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> Our study reveals that key regulatory regions associated with the control of cell identity genes are prone to changes in DNA methylation in reprogramming intermediates in both male and female cells.", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"D": "4"}, "most-sensational": {"B": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
