Parent conversations with children about their weight associated with disordered eating behaviours 	This approach may be particularly important for parents of overweight or obese adolescents. This study builds on recent research focusing on fathers and their role in adolescent eating disorders treatment 32, [41] [42] [43] and finds that adolescents whose fathers engaged in weight conversations were significantly more likely to engage in dieting and UWCBs than adolescents whose fathers did not. Thus, it may be important to educate fathers to avoid any form of weight-related conversations with their adolescents.
