Diet rich in omega 3 (best source = oily fish) could help preserve pancreatic function for kids with T1 #diabetes 	However, significantly reduced risk of development of islet autoimmunity was associated with increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids among youth genetically susceptible to development of type 1 diabetes (36), although continued follow-up did not reveal subsequent protection against incident type 1 diabetes (37).

The results indicate that nasal microbiota has a role in the presentation of viral upper respiratory illness symptoms.	The study team found that the baseline nasal microbiota samples divided into six types named after predominant bacterial genera: (1) Staphylococcus, (2) Corynebacterium/Alloiococcus, (3) Moraxella, (4) Haemophilus, (5) Pseudomonadaceae/Mixed, and (6) Mixed. Each nasal microbiota type had a characteristic inflammatory response and viral load profile. In general, subjects having Staphyloccocus, and Corynebacterium/Alloiococcus types had lower inflammatory responses and Pseudomonadaceae/Mixed type had lower viral load than other types.

Our re-calculations of Swedish trial revealed that risks of breast cancer death were similar for cancers found during the intervention and the post-intervention periods, indicating that reductions in the risk of breast cancer death also applied to cancer cases diagnosed when screening (or absence of screening) was the same in both screening and control groups.	Early detection reduces the risk of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer that is often deadly. If the program is successful, these rates should fall over time, indicating that mammography screening is contributing effectively to reducing breast cancer mortality. Moreover, with increased screening, more rapid and more pronounced falls in breast cancer mortality would be expected in countries that implemented mammography screening program at end of the 1980s than in countries that implemented programs 10 to 15 years later.	The compensation argument invoked by Swedish trial investigators 6, is thus not tenable. Our re-calculations of Swedish trial revealed that risks of breast cancer death were similar for cancers found during the intervention and the post-intervention periods, indicating that reductions in the risk of breast cancer death also applied to cancer cases diagnosed when screening (or absence of screening) was the same in both screening and control groups. Such result is compatible with an effect of being allocated to the screening or to the control group on the risk of breast cancer death (allocation effect), but not with an effect of mammography screening (screening effect) on that risk.

At higher doses, any differences between women who took vitamin D and those who didn't were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance.

Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.
