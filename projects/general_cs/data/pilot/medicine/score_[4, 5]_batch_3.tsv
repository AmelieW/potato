They found a J-shaped association between frequency of drinking and IQ test results, where the daily drinkers had the lowest IQ.	"""It could be the other way around for a minority of individuals, that is, when exposure to alcohol has led to cognitive impairment, but this is less likely to be found among young persons of course."" ""We found that lower results on IQ tests in Swedish adolescent men are associated with a higher consumption of alcohol, measured in both terms of total intake and binge drinking,"" said Sjolund. ""It may be that a higher IQ results in healthier lifestyle choices."	It should be noted that the authors report a skewed study population with regard to low socioeconomic position . They found a J-shaped association between frequency of drinking and IQ test results, where the daily drinkers had the lowest IQ. A higher IQ was associated with being a rare, an occasional, and a moderate drinker, whereas there was a lower IQ for being a former drinker compared with being a lifetime abstainer.

 @username #OA "	These data indicate that improving adherence to healthy dietary patterns could attenuate the genetic association with weight gain. Moreover, the beneficial effect of improved diet quality on weight management was particularly pronounced in people at high genetic risk for obesity. Weights reported in questionnaires and measured by technicians were highly correlated (r=0.97 in both studies) in a validation subsample.

While usual limitations of observational studies like this apply, this analysis suggests eating a healthier diet assessed at midlife was not associated w/subsequent risk for #dementia."	Fourth, as with all observational studies, it was not possible to rule out residual confounding. In this long-term prospective cohort study, diet quality assessed during midlife was not significantly associated with subsequent risk for dementia. The validity and reliability of this version of the FFQ in terms of nutrient and food consumption has been documented in detail both in this cohort and in another independent study in the United Kingdom.

Thrilled that our new paper is out @username:  In this work with Dan Schacter and @username, we show that episodic simulations can form real-life attitudes and how this is supported by affective representations in the vmPFC. 1/5 	Such evaluative conditioning forms attitudes by changing the liking of the CS to align with the valence of the UCS . By this process, episodic simulations modify attitudes toward the very elements that the simulations had been based on, thus influencing how we evaluate our real-life environment. Our hypothesis assigns a key role to the vmPFC in mediating such presumed attitude change.	[4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0]	Medicine	train	4.6	tweets	1129381200391540737

This suggests that pride, rather than other positive emotions, is distinctively involved in social valuation.	"This may explain why pride is a target of righteous indignation around the world. ""A careful mapping of this emotion suggests a different view, however,"" he continues. ""Pride appears to be an elegantly engineered emotion: It makes you pursue socially valued courses of action, and it facilitates the gains in esteem that make those actions worth pursuing."""	Further, pride is specific to audience valuation: Emotions that co-activate with pride, such as happiness and excitement, do not track audience valuation uniquely and reliably. This suggests that pride, rather than other positive emotions, is distinctively involved in social valuation. Further evidence to demonstrate domain-specificity is needed, however.

 "	Restricting to participants with more than 5 years of followup, patients with stress-related disorders had a higher cumulative incidence of autoimmune diseases compared with their matched unexposed individuals across the follow-up period (eFigure3intheSupplement).	"The association of stress disorders with increased risk of autoimmune diseases across 41 conditions @username 
 "	A score of zero shows no comorbidities; the higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher medical resource use. Restricting to participants with more than 5 years of followup, patients with stress-related disorders had a higher cumulative incidence of autoimmune diseases compared with their matched unexposed individuals across the follow-up period (eFigure3intheSupplement). Additional adjustment for medical surveillance level yielded somewhat lower point estimates (eTable 6 in the Supplement) while changing the definitions for history of other psychiatric disorders and autoimmune disease, and the extension of the lag-time period yielded similar results (eTables 7 and 8 in the Supplement).

Late vitamin D supplementation (initiation at ≥20 weeks' gestation) improved birth weight, but early supplementation (initiation at <20 weeks' gestation) did not.	#Vitamin D supplementation during #pregnancy may reduce the risk for underweight babies and fetal or infant mortality. 	We found that maternal vitamin D supplementation timing, dose, and administration method did not affect cord blood vitamin D concentration. Late vitamin D supplementation (initiation at ≥20 weeks' gestation) improved birth weight, but early supplementation (initiation at <20 weeks' gestation) did not. Most importantly, we found that the lower dose of vitamin D supplementation (≤2000 IU/d) reduced the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality and SGA, but the higher dose (>2000 IU/d) did not.

The result, that trichromatic vision is more effective at breaking camouflage, seems to run counter to oft-quoted temperate forest trichromat temperate forest dichromat semi-arid desert trichromat semi-arid desert dichromat historical accounts of the military value of dichromatic observers and contemporary theories for the maintenance of visual pigment polymorphisms in many New World monkey species .	Also, during testing with humans, they found that observers with dichromatic vision (color blindness) took longer to spot strongly colored animals. Those with trichromatic (normal) vision, on the other hand, were very good at breaking camouflage. They suggest their network could be a useful tool for better understanding the role color plays with animals living in the natural world.	Consequently this does not account for the difference between simulated dichromat and trichromat reaction times. The result, that trichromatic vision is more effective at breaking camouflage, seems to run counter to oft-quoted temperate forest trichromat temperate forest dichromat semi-arid desert trichromat semi-arid desert dichromat historical accounts of the military value of dichromatic observers and contemporary theories for the maintenance of visual pigment polymorphisms in many New World monkey species .
