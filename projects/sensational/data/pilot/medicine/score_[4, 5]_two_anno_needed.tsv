Cost-effectiveness of #hpv #vaccines: 	Because of interstate migration and the long duration between HPV infection and resultant cervical cancer, much of the benefit of vaccination will be realized beyond a state's borders. Therefore, both cervical cancer incidence and expenditure can be substantially reduced if the states coordinate policies to promote expansion of coverage, particularly for the new nonavalent vaccine. Both of these vaccines are highly efficacious against HPV-16 and HPV-18 and are partially efficacious against other non-vaccine-targeted oncogenic serotypes .

So excited about my recent publication in @username on a #VLP vaccine targeting #Alzheimers #publishorperish Check it out here: 	Reduction in pathological consequences following this immunotherapy translated into improved cognitive function using well-established measurements of delay-dependent and spatial learning and memory tests. Therefore, we believe that this report provides compelling evidence that a VLP-based immunotherapy approach can be beneficial in preventing tau pathology and could be applicable to diverse human tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In one example, pTau peptide (MAPT 9-8 , pS6/ 4) formulated with an adjuvant (Adju-Phos), induced taureactive antibodies, reduced MC1 and PHF1 positive neurons in the brains of TgP301L mice and rescued cognitive function.

This age profile refines earlier reports of steadily increasing rates of antipsychotic use across multiyear developmental categories of childhood to adolescence 28 to early adulthood.	Use of #antipsychotic meds increased among teens &amp; young adults from 2006-2010 but not among kids 12 or younger. 	There was a rise in antipsychotic use during childhood that extended into adolescence for females, followed by a plateau and a decline during the transition to early adulthood. This age profile refines earlier reports of steadily increasing rates of antipsychotic use across multiyear developmental categories of childhood to adolescence 28 to early adulthood. 29 A peak in antipsychotic use among males aged 11 to 17 years fits with treatment of conduct problems that commonly occur during adolescence.

As such, even absent population and income changes, climate change will demand significant changes to the electric grid. ERCOT covers Texas only and can be thought of as more representative of warmer regions.

This study is the first direct demonstration of liana effects at the ecosystem scale and illustrates the important role of lianas in tropical forests, particularly with respect to carbon budgets.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	By impacting on tree growth and survival, lianas impact the carbon balance of these forests. This study is the first direct demonstration of liana effects at the ecosystem scale and illustrates the important role of lianas in tropical forests, particularly with respect to carbon budgets. Lianas are increasing in biomass and productivity throughout the tropics, and thus our findings have even greater relevance in terms of the fate of the tropical carbon balance, as well as for global atmospheric CO 2 levels, in a changing climate.
