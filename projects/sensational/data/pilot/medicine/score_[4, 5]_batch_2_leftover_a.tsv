10.1001/jama.2018.20578	Medicine_30	With a daily aspirin, 57 rather than 61 people per 10,000 would be expected to suffer a heart attack or stroke; at the same time, 23 rather than 16 people per 10,000 would experience severe bleeding, on average.	In this meta-analysis of 13 trials enrolling 164 225 participants without cardiovascular disease, aspirin use was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome consisting of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.	"That underlines how important it is not to start doing this until you've chatted to your doctor about it. With a daily aspirin, 57 rather than 61 people per 10,000 would be expected to suffer a heart attack or stroke; at the same time, 23 rather than 16 people per 10,000 would experience severe bleeding, on average. ""This seriously questions whether people who have not previously had heart attacks or strokes should be taking aspirin with the aim of reducing future cardiovascular events,"" Zheng told Lisa Rapaport at Reuters."	Aspirin use was associated with increased risk of major bleeding (HR, In this meta-analysis of 13 trials enrolling 164 225 participants without cardiovascular disease, aspirin use was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome consisting of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. However, aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and major gastrointestinal bleeding with comparable absolute risk estimates.

Taken together, our results indicated that aging rat hearts suffered from I/R injury and PC did not improve this injury.	I/R also increased the release of cytochrome c and down-regulated the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt and GSK-3b in the aging rat hearts. We further found that PC increased H2S production rate and CSE expressions, and protected young hearts from I/R-induced cardiomyocytes damage, all of which were disappeared in the aging hearts. Supply of NaHS not only increased PC-induced cardioprotection in the young hearts, but also lightened I/R induced-myocardial damage and significantly recovered the cardioprotective role of PC against I/R induced myocardial damage in the aging hearts.	PC did not change the above mentioned indexes in comparison with the I/R (Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 ). Taken together, our results indicated that aging rat hearts suffered from I/R injury and PC did not improve this injury. H 2 S produced by CSE in cardiovascular system acted as a physiological cardiac function regulator, which protected the cardiac function in ischemic reperfusion or hypoxia .

10.1111/jgs.15671	Medicine_72	The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care.	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment.	The researchers found that 58 percent of nurses gave their hospitals an unfavorable evaluation of end-of-life care overall and 53 percent reported that patients often experience painful procedures that were unlikely to change their outcome. The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care. Compared to nurses in poor-quality environments, nurses in the best environments were less likely to rate their hospital's overall end-of-life care quality unfavorably (odds ratio, 0.45).	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment. Nurses in the best environments were 55% less likely than nurses in poor environments to rate their hospital's overall end-oflife care quality unfavorably (odds ratio = 0.45; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.52; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Quality of end-of-life care in US hospitals is imperfect and is significantly worse in hospitals with poor nurse practice environments than in hospitals with the best environments.
