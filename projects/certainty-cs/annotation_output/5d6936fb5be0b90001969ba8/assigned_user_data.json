We prove that any classical probabilistic circuit composed of bounded fan-in gates that solves the 2D Hidden Linear Function problem with high probability must have depth logarithmic in n. In contrast, we show that this problem can be solved with certainty by a constant-depth quantum circuit composed of one-and two-qubit gates acting locally on a two-dimensional grid. Many problems of practical importance such as Monte Carlo simulation, computing the rank, the determinant, and the inverse of a matrix lend themselves naturally to parallelization .\"><b>Finding:</b></span> We prove that constant-depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their classical counterparts."}, "Computer_Science_tweet_8_r": {"DOI": "10.1287/mnsc.2016.2500", "id": "Computer_Science_tweet_8_r", "News Finding": "@username @username ignoring customer loyalty, this 2013 paper finds that charging a fee for one checked bag correlates with improved on-time departure performance\n\nabstract \npdf  ", "Paper Finding": "We show that, at the aggregate level, the airlines that began charging for one checked bag saw a significant relative improvement in their on-time departure performance in the 35-day period afterwards, compared to the airlines that were not charging for a checked bag during the same time period.", "News Context": "@username @username ignoring customer loyalty, this 2013 paper finds that charging a fee for one checked bag correlates with improved on-time departure performance\n\nabstract \npdf  ", "Paper Context": "As Southwest Airlines might have gotten new customers who used to fly the now-baggage fee charging airlines, we do not have a true experiment, and consequently we do not employ a traditional difference-in-difference approach in our analysis.
