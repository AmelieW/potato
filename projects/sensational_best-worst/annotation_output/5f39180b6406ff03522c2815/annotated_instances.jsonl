If the program is successful, these rates should fall over time, indicating that mammography screening is contributing effectively to reducing breast cancer mortality. Moreover, with increased screening, more rapid and more pronounced falls in breast cancer mortality would be expected in countries that implemented mammography screening program at end of the 1980s than in countries that implemented programs 10 to 15 years later.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> If the program is successful, these rates should fall over time, indicating that mammography screening is contributing effectively to reducing breast cancer mortality.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: The support for a composite surface of TPI and distance from ravines explaining the genetic differentiation for A. annulatum and eastness describing genetic differentiation for A. maculatum extends previous work with A. annulatum and A. maculatum on this landscape. found that no landscape surface described genetic differentiation demonstrably better than distance alone and our work expanding the number of ponds landscape surface described genetic differentiation demonstrably better than distance alone.
