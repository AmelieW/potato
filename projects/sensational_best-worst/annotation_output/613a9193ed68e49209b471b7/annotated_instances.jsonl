A combination of well-controlled procedures minimizing sources of error variance, a repeated-measures design, and large effect sizes led to several significant findings: (a) 1-h of bright light exposure before bedtime suppresses melatonin by~88%; (b) the effects of evening bright light exposure on melatonin levels persisted at least 50-min following termination of the light stimulus; and (c) melatonin levels remained attenuated and did not return to 50% of those observed in the dim light condition following the bright light exposure for the majority of the children.
