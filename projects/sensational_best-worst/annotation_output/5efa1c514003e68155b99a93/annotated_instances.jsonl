Cohort effects were also observed for some subgroups, particularly in $7 hours of sleep for male subjects, white subjects, and those in urban areas; those in the earliest cohorts, as well as cohorts born in the early 1990s, were more likely to report regular $7 hours of sleep compared with all other adolescents. Third, we documented that girls are less likely to regularly report $7 hours of sleep and to feel they get adequate sleep, as are black/Hispanic adolescents and those in lower SES strata.\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Cohort effects were also observed for some subgroups, particularly in $7 hours of sleep for male subjects, white subjects, and those in urban areas; those in the earliest cohorts, as well as cohorts born in the early 1990s, were more likely to report regular $7 hours of sleep compared with all other adolescents.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Titze and his colleagues realized that immune cells arriving in wounded skin to fight infections were entering a salty microenvironment.
