These results are very similar to those expected from the parallel models that exist between certain personality traits and being overweight in humans, suggesting that dogs are indeed a promising model for experimentally investigating obesity in humans. Dogs, due to their shared living environment with humans, may provide a beneficial model to study the causes and consequences of obesity.\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> These results are very similar to those expected from the parallel models that exist between certain personality traits and being overweight in humans, suggesting that dogs are indeed a promising model for experimentally investigating obesity in humans.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: At the start of each migration, all 14 seals were negatively buoyant, as indicated by the negative drift rate values (figure 1; electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ).
