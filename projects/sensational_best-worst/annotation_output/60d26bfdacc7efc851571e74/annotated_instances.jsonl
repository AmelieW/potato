However, with narrow-ranged species concentrating their ED over a small area, parts of the phylogeny are potentially, and precariously, represented only in restricted areas of the world. Indeed, global change is expected to induce both rapid range extensions and range losses in species, often quite independent of current formal threat categorizations , with direct consequences for the spatial concentration and thus potential for global loss of evolutionary information.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> However, with narrow-ranged species concentrating their ED over a small area, parts of the phylogeny are potentially, and precariously, represented only in restricted areas of the world.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Is Diet Quality Associated With Later Risk for Dementia?\\n@username \\n\\nWhile usual limitations of observational studies like this apply, this analysis suggests eating a healthier diet assessed at midlife was not associated w/subsequent risk for #dementia.\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> Is Diet Quality Associated With Later Risk for Dementia?\\n@username \\n\\nWhile usual limitations of observational studies like this apply, this analysis suggests eating a healthier diet assessed at midlife was not associated w/subsequent risk for #dementia.", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"A": "1"}, "most-sensational": {"D": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 0s "}}
