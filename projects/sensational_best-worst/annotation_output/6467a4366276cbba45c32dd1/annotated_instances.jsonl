It is the opinion of the authors that regulatory and other nonvoluntary methods are now required to reduce the aluminium content of infant formulas and thereby protect infants from chronic exposure to dietary aluminium. However, the range of values obtained was skewed towards high content and we were left to conclude that the aluminium content of infant formulas were too high, for example as compared to aluminium exposure through breast milk .\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> It is the opinion of the authors that regulatory and other nonvoluntary methods are now required to reduce the aluminium content of infant formulas and thereby protect infants from chronic exposure to dietary aluminium.", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"B": "2"}, "most-sensational": {"A": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 32s "}}
