A combination of well-controlled procedures minimizing sources of error variance, a repeated-measures design, and large effect sizes led to several significant findings: (a) 1-h of bright light exposure before bedtime suppresses melatonin by~88%; (b) the effects of evening bright light exposure on melatonin levels persisted at least 50-min following termination of the light stimulus; and (c) melatonin levels remained attenuated and did not return to 50% of those observed in the dim light condition following the bright light exposure for the majority of the children. Findings from this study mark an important step in addressing a gap in understanding the melatonin suppression response across the lifespan.\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> A combination of well-controlled procedures minimizing sources of error variance, a repeated-measures design, and large effect sizes led to several significant findings: (a) 1-h of bright light exposure before bedtime suppresses melatonin by~88%; (b) the effects of evening bright light exposure on melatonin levels persisted at least 50-min following termination of the light stimulus; and (c) melatonin levels remained attenuated and did not return to 50% of those observed in the dim light condition following the bright light exposure for the majority of the children."}, "Experience.html": {"id": "Experience.html", "text": "Experience", "displayed_text": "Experience"}, "End.html": {"id": "End.html", "text": "End", "displayed_text": "End"}}
