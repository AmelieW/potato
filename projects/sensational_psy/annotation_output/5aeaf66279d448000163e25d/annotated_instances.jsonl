This research could lead to better sleep quality for people with depression, and opens up the possibility of new targeted treatments. In the brains of those living with depressive problems, they discovered a strong connection between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with short-term memory), the precuneus (associated with the self), and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (associated with negative emotion).\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> The researchers found functional connectivity between the areas of the brain associated with short-term memory, self, and negative emotions, which cause sufferers to dwell on bad thoughts and lead to a poor quality of sleep.", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"D": "4"}, "most-sensational": {"C": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 30s "}}
