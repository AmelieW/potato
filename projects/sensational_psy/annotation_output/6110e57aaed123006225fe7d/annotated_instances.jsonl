The results from study 1 provide support for the hypothesis that behaviorally targeted advertisements can act as implied social labels, resulting in adjustments to behavior consistent with the label. Consumers in the behaviorally targeted and the demographically targeted condition felt equally that the ad was matched to personal information from earlier in the experimental session (to a significantly greater extent than participants in the control, nontargeted condition).\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> The results from study 1 provide support for the hypothesis that behaviorally targeted advertisements can act as implied social labels, resulting in adjustments to behavior consistent with the label.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: 9 These factors cut across various domains including affective (eg, emotion dysregulation, psychiatric disorder), cognitive (eg, attitudes toward women, beliefs about violence), demographic (eg, age, race, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status), interpersonal (eg, relationship satisfaction, problem solving skills), contextual (eg, availability of weapon, drug/alcohol use), as well as distal factors (eg, history of child abuse, exposure to family violence).

We propose that the effects of a social label implied by a behaviorally targeted ad are akin to informing a consumer of their revealed preferences (based on past choices that are affected by the external environment), and those of identity priming are akin to reminding a consumer of their stated preferences (generated from accessing internal information). Consumers therefore receive information about what others (i.e., the marketer) think about them (based on observing their choices and other past behavior) when they receive a behaviorally targeted ad, a process distinct from making an identity salient because it involves an external indication that one has a trait or set of traits.\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> We propose that the effects of a social label implied by a behaviorally targeted ad are akin to informing a consumer of their revealed preferences (based on past choices that are affected by the external environment), and those of identity priming are akin to reminding a consumer of their stated preferences (generated from accessing internal information).", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"A": "1"}, "most-sensational": {"D": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 30s "}}
