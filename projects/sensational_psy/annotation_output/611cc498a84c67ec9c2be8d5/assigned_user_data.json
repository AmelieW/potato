Our work suggests that effective altruists may face stumbling blocks in how they are perceived by others and that, while receiving far less criticism than consequentialists can receive for endorsing instrumental harm, this may still have harmful consequences for how the movement is perceived and therefore, presumably, how many people join the movement and adopt its principles.\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> In this way, the consequentialist action in our impartiality dilemmas we used in this study -and especially the spending money variant -directly match onto the action that we should do on effective altruism principles.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: While children in both groups made progress, those receiving ESDM showed significantly higher gains in language (20 DQ points versus 10 in the control group) and cognition (14 DQ points, versus 7 in the control group).
