These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease. Reduced HRV is a marker of decreased ANS flexibility and may reflect an increase in the sympathetic nervous system and/or a decrease in the parasympathetic nervous system modulation.\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Research article:  \"People of low cognitive ability tend to be prejudiced against non-conventional or liberal... \"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Research article:  \"People of low cognitive ability tend to be prejudiced against non-conventional or liberal... <br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Neural mechanisms linking depressive symptoms with sleep disturbances (n = 1,017)\\n\\n\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> Neural mechanisms linking depressive symptoms with sleep disturbances (n = 1,017)\\n\\n<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: algorithmic reflections of behavior still result in identity shift effects. this paper found that behaviorally targeted advertising can influence self-perceptions through implied social labels\\n\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> algorithmic reflections of behavior still result in identity shift effects. this paper found that behaviorally targeted advertising can influence self-perceptions through implied social labels\\n", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"C": "3"}, "most-sensational": {"A": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
