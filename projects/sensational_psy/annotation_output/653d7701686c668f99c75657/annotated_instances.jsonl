The researchers suggest that more than 50 percent of the participants were exposed to some type of trauma and about 66 percent women, who experienced trauma, reported to have at least one lifetime PTSD symptom. Around 8 percent of these women also reported to have between 6 and 7 PTSD symptoms, which was the maximum on the questionnaire they had filled.\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> The researchers suggest that women who reported more PTSD symptoms were more likely to have food addiction when measured via the Yale Food Addiction Scale, which assess dependency on food.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: This is likely easier to accomplish for lifestyle brands and brands with strong personalities .
