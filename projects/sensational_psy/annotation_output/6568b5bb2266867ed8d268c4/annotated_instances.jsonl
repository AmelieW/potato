Importantly, we observe that happiness increases before birth, suggesting that the happiness gain around the time of birth may capture not only the effect of the birth but also the complex childbearing process that may involve partnership formation, partnership quality, and increased sexual activity. We then analyze the patterns for different socioeconomic groups and parities and show that the changes in subjective well-being over the transition to parenthood are highly consistent with the low and late fertility behavior that has emerged during the second demographic transition: older parents and those with more socioeconomic resources have the strongest happiness gains around the time of birth, and the temporary happiness gain around the time of birth declines with the number of children that one already has.\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Importantly, we observe that happiness increases before birth, suggesting that the happiness gain around the time of birth may capture not only the effect of the birth but also the complex childbearing process that may involve partnership formation, partnership quality, and increased sexual activity.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: The corresponding contrasts were not significant in the condition without partner touch (\u0394\u03b6 nt(p) = 0.002, p = 0.56, men), (\u0394\u03b6 nt(p) = 0.001, p < 0.73, women) ( Fig. We found significant moderation of the effect of women\\'s analgesia and touch on the cross-partner synchronization in velocity of respiration fluctuations (F (4,28000) = 26.59, p < 0.0001, \u0394BIC = \u2212418367.9, \u0394R 2 = 0.19).
