Our results show that the human visual system can retain plasticity beyond critical periods, even after early and extended blindness. Access to this population allowed us to examine contrast sensitivity across a large sample of sight restoration patients compared with previous reports .\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> Our results show that the human visual system can retain plasticity beyond critical periods, even after early and extended blindness.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Specifically, moderate intoxication terms were applied to and from women more than men, even when the character was heavily intoxicated, whereas heavy intoxication terms were applied to and from men more than women. Conclusions: The findings suggest that gender differences in the application of intoxication terms are other-directed as well as self-directed and that intoxication language can inform gender-specific prevention and intervention efforts targeting problematic alcohol use among college students. Understanding this language can provide critical insight into subjective perceptions of intoxicated states, particularly among specific groups in the general drinking population such as college students that demonstrate elevated levels of heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related consequences.\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> Conclusions: The findings suggest that gender differences in the application of intoxication terms are other-directed as well as self-directed and that intoxication language can inform gender-specific prevention and intervention efforts targeting problematic alcohol use among college students.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Pet dogs help kids feel less stressed! \\nNew research from our lab.
