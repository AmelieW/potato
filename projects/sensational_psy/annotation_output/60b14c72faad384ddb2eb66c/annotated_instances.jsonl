Study 2 demonstrates that the effects of behavioral targeting on purchase intentions are mediated by the recognition that the ad implies something about the consumer\\'s identity and the subsequent adjustments in self-perceptions that result from recognizing this implied label.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> The results show that behaviorally targeted ads result in increased purchase intentions for the advertised product, an effect mediated by consumers\\' recognition of the ad as an implied social label.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Results In all, 19% of participants (n = 134) reported physical dating violence perpetration and 68% reported experiencing corporal punishment as children (n = 498).
