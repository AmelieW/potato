These findings provides a neural basis for understanding how depression is associated with poor sleep quality, and this in turn has implications for treatment because of the brain areas identified. Areas in which functional connectivity was associated with depressive problems and their effects on sleep quality included the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, precuneus, and angular gyrus.\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> These findings provides a neural basis for understanding how depression is associated with poor sleep quality, and this in turn has implications for treatment because of the brain areas identified.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: They found that regardless of cultural background circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing ASD.

Our study confirms and extends findings from previous longitudinal studies of post-infective fatigue syndrome, which have observed greater fatigue at initial presentation to clinics, around four weeks post-infection, in those who would go on to experience persistent fatigue VollmerConna et al., 2007) . Interestingly, by adding a \\'baseline\\' assessment before IFN-\u03b1 (i.e., equivalent to a hitherto unavailable fatigue measurement before the infection), our study shows that pre-treatment levels of fatigue are not a good predictor of the development of CFS in response to an immune challenge.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> Our study confirms and extends findings from previous longitudinal studies of post-infective fatigue syndrome, which have observed greater fatigue at initial presentation to clinics, around four weeks post-infection, in those who would go on to experience persistent fatigue VollmerConna et al., 2007) .<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: #Stroke survivors can have \u201csignificant\u201d improvement in arm movements after using interactive video games \"><b>Finding D:</b></span> #Stroke survivors can have \u201csignificant\u201d improvement in arm movements after using interactive video games ", "label_annotations": {"most-neutral": {"A": "1"}, "most-sensational": {"D": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 20s "}}
