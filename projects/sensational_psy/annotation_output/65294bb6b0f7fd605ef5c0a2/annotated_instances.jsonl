The findings suggest that WET is an efficacious and efficient PTSD treatment that may reduce attrition and transcend previously observed barriers to PTSD treatment for both patients and providers. 3 Also included in this recommended group of treatments is written narrative exposure, which the clinical practice guideline notes is a simple, yet effective, way to deliver exposure therapy for PTSD.\"><b>Finding B:</b></span> The findings suggest that WET is an efficacious and efficient PTSD treatment that may reduce attrition and transcend previously observed barriers to PTSD treatment for both patients and providers.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: A mediation analysis showed that these functional connectivities underlie the association of the Depressive Problems score with poor sleep quality (\u03b2 = 0.0139; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The implication of these findings is that the increased functional connectivity between these brain regions provides a neural basis for the association between depression and poor sleep quality. An important finding was that the Depressive Problems scores in this general population were correlated with functional connectivities between areas, including the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, precuneus, angular gyrus, and temporal cortex.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The implication of these findings is that the increased functional connectivity between these brain regions provides a neural basis for the association between depression and poor sleep quality.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Much smaller associations were found in the reverse direction; that is, the associations of sleep quality with depressive problems mediated by these links were less significant.
