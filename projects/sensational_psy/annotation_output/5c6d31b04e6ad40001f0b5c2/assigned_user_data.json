Heritability estimates for behavioral traits, typically between 30% and 50%, are by far the largest effect sizes in psychological science. In retrospect, it is amazing that inherited DNA differences can work their way through the complexities of pathways from genes to brain to behavior and end up accounting for so much of the variance of complex psychological traits.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> Heritability estimates for behavioral traits, typically between 30% and 50%, are by far the largest effect sizes in psychological science.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: 3 , the interaction of target condition and birth experience was also not significant, F(1, 352) = 0.08, n.s., indicating that the differences in saccade latencies of vaginally delivered infants relative to infants delivered by caesarean section were similar when a target was presented alone (vaginal .
