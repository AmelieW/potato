Early pseudomature behavior also predicted higher adult levels of more serious criminal behavior, alcohol and drug use, and problems associated with such use. Cumulative continuity theory again suggests an explanation in which early pseudomature behavior may alter critical contexts in which adolescents are developing so as to lead to more serious criminal behavior in the future.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> Early pseudomature behavior also predicted higher adult levels of more serious criminal behavior, alcohol and drug use, and problems associated with such use.<br><span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: The more physiologically synchronized they were, the less pain she felt. \"It could be that touch is a tool for communicating empathy, resulting in an analgesic, or pain-killing, effect,\" said Goldstein.
