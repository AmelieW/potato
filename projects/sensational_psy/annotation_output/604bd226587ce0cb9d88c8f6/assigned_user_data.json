Although previous studies have found changes in patients with depression in some of the regions of interest identified in this study, including the precuneus and angular gyrus, 43 this is to our knowledge the first study to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the associations of depressive problems with sleep quality and to associate sleep quality with functional connectivity in a large sample of participants. A strength of this investigation is that the effects are likely to be very robust, given the large sample of participants with resting-state fMRI and the cross-validation with the UK Biobank data set with a sample of 8718 participants in one of its first uses of resting-state fMRI data.\"><b>Finding D:</b></span> Although previous studies have found changes in patients with depression in some of the regions of interest identified in this study, including the precuneus and angular gyrus, 43 this is to our knowledge the first study to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the associations of depressive problems with sleep quality and to associate sleep quality with functional connectivity in a large sample of participants."}, "Psychology_448_r$Psychology_tweet_179_r$Psychology_53_r$Psychology_351_p": {"id": "Psychology_448_r$Psychology_tweet_179_r$Psychology_53_r$Psychology_351_p", "text": "<span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: \"Controlling these factors is just as important as taking medications,\" Fries said.
