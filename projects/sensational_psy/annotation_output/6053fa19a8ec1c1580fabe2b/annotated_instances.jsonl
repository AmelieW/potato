This might be one of the reasons why we only detected significant differences in epigenetic aging in older subjects, especially considering the key role proposed for chronic stress and the high rates of unhealthy lifestyles seen in BD patients . Our findings suggest that accelerated epigenetic aging in BD may be at least partially associated with an increase in mtDNA copy number.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> This might be one of the reasons why we only detected significant differences in epigenetic aging in older subjects, especially considering the key role proposed for chronic stress and the high rates of unhealthy lifestyles seen in BD patients .<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: For example, adults listening to spoken sentences look at a possible visual referent even when the visual array is irrelevant to the task (for a review see , and even look to shape-similar items when that item is clearly not the referent of the uttered word (e.g. By hypothesis, the underlying mechanism for these effects may be fundamentally the same as the one proposed here: Heard words yield representations (either expectations or biased encoding of seen things) in visual working memory and these active representations then drive where one looks in a scene.
