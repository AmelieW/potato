Although the development of an adaptive strategies questionnaire to determine the extent of engagement in adaptive strategies and the relationship of adaptive strategies to remaining HIV negative over time was the end-goal of our study, we also see applicability of our qualitative findings to the development of a risk reduction intervention.
