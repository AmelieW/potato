10.1001/jama.2018.20578	Medicine_94	They found that while it was associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, it did lead to an increased risk of major bleeding.	The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.	"They found that while it was associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, it did lead to an increased risk of major bleeding. The results showed that:

Aspirin use was associated with an 11% lower risk of cardiovascular events. Approximately 250 patients needed to be treated with aspirin for 5 years to prevent a single heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death."	6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0.51% (5% CI, 0.06%-0.3%) for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of 0.64% (5% CI, 0.35%-0.7%) for major bleeding. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude. Aspirin use was not associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, and deaths due to bleeding were rare.

The 5-year cumulative primary outcome event rate was not significantly different between the groups (2.77% [95% CI, 2.40%-3.20%] for aspirin vs 2.96% [95% CI, 2.58%-3.40%] for no aspirin; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77-1.15]; P = .54).	The researchers found that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in time to the primary end point (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal heart attack). At 5 years after randomization, the cumulative primary event rate was similar in participants in the aspirin group (2.77 percent) and those in the no aspirin group (2.96 percent). Aspirin significantly reduced incidence of nonfatal heart attack and transient ischemic attack, and significantly increased the risk of extracranial hemorrhage requiring transfusion or hospitalization.	Patients with an occurrence of nonfatal stroke totaled 114 in the aspirin group and 108 in the no aspirin group; of nonfatal myocardial infarction, 20 in the aspirin group and 38 in the no aspirin group; of undefined cerebrovascular events, 3 in the aspirin group and 5 in the no aspirin group. The 5-year cumulative primary outcome event rate was not significantly different between the groups (2.77% [95% CI, 2.40%-3.20%] for aspirin vs 2.96% [95% CI, 2.58%-3.40%] for no aspirin; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77-1.15]; P = .54). Aspirin significantly reduced incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (0.30 [95% CI, 0.19-0.47] for aspirin vs 0.58 [95% CI, 0.42-0.81] for no aspirin; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.31-0.91]; P = .02) and transient ischemic attack (0.26 [95% CI, 0.16-0.42] for aspirin vs 0.49 [95% CI, 0.35-0.69] for no aspirin; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.32-0.99]; P = .04), and significantly increased the risk of extracranial hemorrhage requiring transfusion or hospitalization (0.86 [95% CI, 0.67-1.11] for aspirin vs 0.51 [95% CI, 0.37-0.72] for no aspirin; HR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.22-2.81]; P = .004).

In conclusion, low HRV may be a risk factor for female sexual arousal dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction.	Do women with sexual arousal disorders just need a little more giddyap in their heartbeat? 	Women with below average HRV were significantly more likely to report sexual arousal dysfunction (p \ .001) and overall sexual dysfunction (p \ .001) than both women with average HRV and women with above average HRV. In conclusion, low HRV may be a risk factor for female sexual arousal dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction. Given these findings, it is reasonable to expect ANS activity (indexed by HRV) may be related to women's self-reported, real-life sexual arousal function outside of the laboratory.

Hence, the explanation for the observed prevalence of sound-meaning associations across the world has to be found elsewhere (49).	"""Likely it has something to do with the human mind or brain, our ways of interacting, or signals we use when we learn or process language. That's a key question for future research."" Sound-meaning association biases evidenced across thousands of languages."	These results suggest that, although it is possible that the presence of signals in some families are symptomatic of a particularly pervasive cognate set, this is not the usual case. Hence, the explanation for the observed prevalence of sound-meaning associations across the world has to be found elsewhere (49). We have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of words in the basic vocabulary are biased to carry or to avoid specific sound segments, both across continents and linguistic lineages.

Taken together, our results indicated that aging rat hearts suffered from I/R injury and PC did not improve this injury.	I/R also increased the release of cytochrome c and down-regulated the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt and GSK-3b in the aging rat hearts. We further found that PC increased H2S production rate and CSE expressions, and protected young hearts from I/R-induced cardiomyocytes damage, all of which were disappeared in the aging hearts. Supply of NaHS not only increased PC-induced cardioprotection in the young hearts, but also lightened I/R induced-myocardial damage and significantly recovered the cardioprotective role of PC against I/R induced myocardial damage in the aging hearts.	PC did not change the above mentioned indexes in comparison with the I/R (Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 ). Taken together, our results indicated that aging rat hearts suffered from I/R injury and PC did not improve this injury. H 2 S produced by CSE in cardiovascular system acted as a physiological cardiac function regulator, which protected the cardiac function in ischemic reperfusion or hypoxia .

10.1111/jgs.15671	Medicine_72	The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care.	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment.	The researchers found that 58 percent of nurses gave their hospitals an unfavorable evaluation of end-of-life care overall and 53 percent reported that patients often experience painful procedures that were unlikely to change their outcome. The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care. Compared to nurses in poor-quality environments, nurses in the best environments were less likely to rate their hospital's overall end-of-life care quality unfavorably (odds ratio, 0.45).	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment. Nurses in the best environments were 55% less likely than nurses in poor environments to rate their hospital's overall end-oflife care quality unfavorably (odds ratio = 0.45; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.52; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Quality of end-of-life care in US hospitals is imperfect and is significantly worse in hospitals with poor nurse practice environments than in hospitals with the best environments.

Our study had a number of strengths.	"""Older adults are a diverse group of patients whose risk of postoperative complications is not solely defined by their age, comorbidities or the type of surgical procedure they receive,"" said Dr. Watt. ""This study highlights how common postoperative complications are among older adults undergoing elective surgery, and the importance of geriatric syndromes, including frailty, in identifying older adults who may be at risk."" The review did not examine why frailty was associated with negative outcomes following surgery, but the authors hypothesize that frailty and not older age was associated with postoperative complications because frailty represents a patient's biological age as opposed to their chronological age."	This is a limitation that is inherent in the prognosis literature that we hope will be overcome in the future by improved quality of reporting. Our study had a number of strengths. The hypothesis-generating nature of this study allowed for the identification of prognostic factors that are potentially modifiable in the preoperative setting, which could lead to better surgical outcomes for older adults undergoing elective surgery.

In aggregate, the bifidobacterial species distribution did not differ greatly between secretor-fed infants and non-secretor-fed infants.	The research may have applications in a clinical setting for protecting premature infants from a range of intestinal diseases including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a condition that is the second most common cause of death among premature infants in the United States. The researchers emphasized that the finding does not suggest that breast milk from mothers without an active copy of the gene is less nourishing or healthy. Rather, it conveys the subtle and elegant choreography of one part of the human microbiome: The relationships between the mothers' genetics, the composition of her breast milk and the development of thier infants' gut microbiota.	However, it may be that only some bifidobacterial species would possess this advantage, due to differences in abilities of various species to consume fucosylated substrates. In aggregate, the bifidobacterial species distribution did not differ greatly between secretor-fed infants and non-secretor-fed infants. As the species of bifidobacteria present within an infant are dependent on environmental exposure, we tentatively conclude that this subset of geographically co-located infants was exposed to similar sets of bifidobacterial species.
