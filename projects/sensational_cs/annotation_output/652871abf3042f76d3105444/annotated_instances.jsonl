The results revealed that even for this subset there was still a significant effect of mixed reality (over virtual) on learning (p<0.01).\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> Our experimental results provide evidence that observing physical phenomena in the context of an interactive mixedreality game plays an important role for learning and enjoyment, while adding simple physical controls such as having the kids shake the tablet in a screen-only game or press the physical switch in a mixed-reality game does not have an effect on learning or enjoyment.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: It can happen immediately using existing data, often with only modest reframing of the questions asked and the approaches taken.
