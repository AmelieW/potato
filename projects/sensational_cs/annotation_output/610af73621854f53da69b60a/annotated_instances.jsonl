We have demonstrated the feasibility of adaptive DBS in PD using a fully implantable device, with feedback control provided by a cortical gamma band oscillation related to the emergence of dyskinesia, a common adverse effect of levodopa therapy and of STN DBS. While the total energy delivered by adaptive stimulation was substantially less than that of open-loop stimulation, blinded clinical ratings confirmed similar efficacy for both approaches.\"><b>Finding C:</b></span> We have demonstrated the feasibility of adaptive DBS in PD using a fully implantable device, with feedback control provided by a cortical gamma band oscillation related to the emergence of dyskinesia, a common adverse effect of levodopa therapy and of STN DBS.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: And second, among the categories representing direct evidence of scale-free structure, not a single network data set falls into the Strong or Strongest categories.
