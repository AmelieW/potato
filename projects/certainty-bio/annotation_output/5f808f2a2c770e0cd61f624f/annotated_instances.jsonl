This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates.

The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.\"><b>Finding:</b></span> The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death.", "label_annotations": {"how-certain-is-the-finding": {"Certain": "4"}}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 798, "end": 804, "span": " found", "annotation": "Words indicating certainty"}, {"start": 834, "end": 845, "span": "accumulated", "annotation": "Words indicating certainty"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 30s "}}
