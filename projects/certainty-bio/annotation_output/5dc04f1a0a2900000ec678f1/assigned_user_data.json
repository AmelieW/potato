Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.", "Paper Context": "Long-term Submission PDF biomass carbon storage may be further reduced if increasing liana biomass intensifies liana-tree competition and/or increases the proportion of trees that are competing with lianas. Likewise, a potential liana-driven shift in tree species composition may also alter long-term biomass carbon storage if the presence of lianas leads to an increase in fast-growing trees with low wood densities, as is predicted . Nevertheless, our simulation provides an initial conservative estimate of the potential long-term effect of lianas on forest-level carbon stocks.", "scores": "[4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0]", "field": "Biology", "split": "train", "final_score": 3.6, "source": "news", "News URL": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechnologyOrg/~3/PUyOGba13Ho/", "text": "['<span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: Long-term Submission PDF biomass carbon storage may be further reduced if increasing liana biomass intensifies liana-tree competition and/or increases the proportion of trees that are competing with lianas.
