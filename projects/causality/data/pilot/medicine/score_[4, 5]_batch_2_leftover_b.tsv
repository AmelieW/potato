10.1001/jama.2018.20578	Medicine_94	They found that while it was associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, it did lead to an increased risk of major bleeding.	The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.	"They found that while it was associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, it did lead to an increased risk of major bleeding. The results showed that:

Aspirin use was associated with an 11% lower risk of cardiovascular events. Approximately 250 patients needed to be treated with aspirin for 5 years to prevent a single heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death."	6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0.51% (5% CI, 0.06%-0.3%) for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of 0.64% (5% CI, 0.35%-0.7%) for major bleeding. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude. Aspirin use was not associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, and deaths due to bleeding were rare.

In this meta-analysis of 13 trials enrolling 164 225 participants without cardiovascular disease, aspirin use was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome consisting of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.	"That underlines how important it is not to start doing this until you've chatted to your doctor about it. With a daily aspirin, 57 rather than 61 people per 10,000 would be expected to suffer a heart attack or stroke; at the same time, 23 rather than 16 people per 10,000 would experience severe bleeding, on average. ""This seriously questions whether people who have not previously had heart attacks or strokes should be taking aspirin with the aim of reducing future cardiovascular events,"" Zheng told Lisa Rapaport at Reuters."	Aspirin use was associated with increased risk of major bleeding (HR, In this meta-analysis of 13 trials enrolling 164 225 participants without cardiovascular disease, aspirin use was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome consisting of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. However, aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and major gastrointestinal bleeding with comparable absolute risk estimates.

In conclusion, low HRV may be a risk factor for female sexual arousal dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction.	Do women with sexual arousal disorders just need a little more giddyap in their heartbeat? 	Women with below average HRV were significantly more likely to report sexual arousal dysfunction (p \ .001) and overall sexual dysfunction (p \ .001) than both women with average HRV and women with above average HRV. In conclusion, low HRV may be a risk factor for female sexual arousal dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction. Given these findings, it is reasonable to expect ANS activity (indexed by HRV) may be related to women's self-reported, real-life sexual arousal function outside of the laboratory.
