Professor Exley said: \"Clearly the manufacturers of infant formulas are not concerned about reducing their content of aluminium and the extensive use of aluminium-based packaging for infant formulas seems to confirm this. \"There are no adequate criteria upon which to base a safety level for aluminium in infant formulas and for this reason it would be sensible to take action to reduce the level of aluminium to a lowest practicable level.", "Paper Context": "The concentration of aluminium in each of the 30 infant formulas is at least twice that which is recommended in the European Union for drinking water (50 \u03bcg/L) and in 14 of the milks it exceeds the maximum admissible level for drinking water of 200 \u03bcg/L . We consider that the aluminium content of all infant formulas investigated herein is too high and especially so considering that these products constitute either all or a substantial proportion of an infant's diet in the first months of their lives. Based upon the criteria for drinking water they are not fit for human consumption and they contravene article 5 of the Food Safety Act which states that 'infant formulas should not contain anything which might endanger the health of infants and young children' .", "scores": "[4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0]", "field": "Medicine", "split": "train", "final_score": 4.0, "source": "news", "News URL": "http://www.healthcanal.com/child-health/43790-action-needed-now-to-lower-the-content-of-aluminium-in-infant-formulas.html", "text": "['<span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: The concentration of aluminium in each of the 30 infant formulas is at least twice that which is recommended in the European Union for drinking water (50 \u03bcg/L) and in 14 of the milks it exceeds the maximum admissible level for drinking water of 200 \u03bcg/L .
