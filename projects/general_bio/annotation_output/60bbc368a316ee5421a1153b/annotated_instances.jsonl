The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.\"><b>Finding A:</b></span> The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death.<br><span id=\"hover_text_paper\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Paper context: Because biomass dynamics of lianas are included in the whole-forest estimates, our findings corroborate earlier research that lianas themselves do not compensate for the loss in tree biomass that they cause .
