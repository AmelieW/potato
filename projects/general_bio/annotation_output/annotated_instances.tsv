Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others. If populations are to benefit from the protection afforded by MPAs, it is necessary that a number of individuals spend a substantial part of their lives within their boundaries .""><b>Finding B:</b></span> Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others."	2
