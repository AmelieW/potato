The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.	"They found that while it was associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, it did lead to an increased risk of major bleeding. The results showed that:

Aspirin use was associated with an 11% lower risk of cardiovascular events. Approximately 250 patients needed to be treated with aspirin for 5 years to prevent a single heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death."	6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0.51% (5% CI, 0.06%-0.3%) for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of 0.64% (5% CI, 0.35%-0.7%) for major bleeding. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude. Aspirin use was not associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, and deaths due to bleeding were rare.

In this meta-analysis of 13 trials enrolling 164 225 participants without cardiovascular disease, aspirin use was associated with reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome consisting of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.

In conclusion, low HRV may be a risk factor for female sexual arousal dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction.	Do women with sexual arousal disorders just need a little more giddyap in their heartbeat? 	Women with below average HRV were significantly more likely to report sexual arousal dysfunction (p \ .001) and overall sexual dysfunction (p \ .001) than both women with average HRV and women with above average HRV. In conclusion, low HRV may be a risk factor for female sexual arousal dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction. Given these findings, it is reasonable to expect ANS activity (indexed by HRV) may be related to women's self-reported, real-life sexual arousal function outside of the laboratory.

At the intensively monitored site, illegal killing increased markedly after 2008 and was correlated strongly with the local black market ivory price and increased seizures of ivory destined for China.	This surge was directly correlated to a more than quadrupling of local black-market ivory prices paid to poachers and tripling in the volume and number of illegal ivory seizures through Kenyan ports of transit. The data also show that the destination of the illegally trafficked ivory increasingly shifted to China. Such figures cause conservationists alarm, as the study shows over 54 percent is a level of poaching that elephant birth rates are unable to overcome and will lead to population decline.	At the intensively monitored site, illegal killing increased markedly after 2008 and was correlated strongly with the local black market ivory price and increased seizures of ivory destined for China. More broadly, results from application to continental data indicated illegal killing levels were unsustainable for the species between 2010 and 2012, peaking to ∼8% in 2011 which extrapolates to ∼40,000 elephants illegally killed and a probable species reduction of ∼3% that year. Preliminary data from 2013 indicate overharvesting continued.

A new study on dog behavior may help us better understand how human personalities affect obesity. The scientists thought that the obese dogs would be more likely to wait for the potential high-value meal, that they would do anything for something big and tasty. However, that was not the case.
