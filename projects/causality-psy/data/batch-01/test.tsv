10.1177/1745691615617439	Psychology_426	The Big Five personality dimensions show about 40-60 percent heritability rates, indicating that a sizeable portion of personality appears to be determined by genetic factors.<br>Heritability estimates for behavioral traits, typically between 30% and 50%, are by far the largest effect sizes in psychological science.	Heritability estimates for behavioral traits, typically between 30% and 50%, are by far the largest effect sizes in psychological science.	Of interest, concordance rates for identical twins reared apart were similar to those of identical twins raised together, suggesting the environmental influence was based on unshared environmental variables. The Big Five personality dimensions show about 40-60 percent heritability rates, indicating that a sizeable portion of personality appears to be determined by genetic factors. This area of study is complex and beyond the scope of this article, but the field is quickly progressing.	The most important reason for the reproducibility of behavioral genetic results is that genetic effect sizes are large. Heritability estimates for behavioral traits, typically between 30% and 50%, are by far the largest effect sizes in psychological science. In retrospect, it is amazing that inherited DNA differences can work their way through the complexities of pathways from genes to brain to behavior and end up accounting for so much of the variance of complex psychological traits.

Our study indicates an important role of H 2 S in protecting against the aging cardiovascular disease.	LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) abolished but N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species, ROS) further enhanced the protective role of H2S against I/R induced myocardial damage in the aging hearts. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that exogenous H2S recovers PC-induced cardioprotection via inhibition of oxidative stress and up-regulation of PI3K-Akt-GSK-3b pathway in the aging rat hearts. These findings suggested that H2S might be a novel target for the treatment of aging cardiovascular diseases.

This theory suggests that efforts to attain status with peers via superficial, pseudomature behaviors might lead to future difficulties because these pseudomature behaviors replace efforts to develop positive social skills and meaningful friendships and thus leave teens less developmentally mature and socially competent over time.
