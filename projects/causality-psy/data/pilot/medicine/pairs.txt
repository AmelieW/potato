Reported finding: Circuit training is also a great way to improve your muscular endurance and strength.
News Finding: In conclusion, I observed how circuit training at home can improve the calcaneus QUS status, such as QUS-SI, QUS-SOS, and QUS-BUA, as well as build muscle while losing fat mass through easy sports activities among young females.

Reported finding: Meta-analysis evaluating aspirin for primary prevention in cardiovascular disease – the double-edged sword: NNT 265  (to prevent CV mortality/nonfatal MI + stroke); NNH 210 (major bleeding). #JAMA #CVD
 
News Finding: The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.

Reported finding: So excited about my recent publication in @username on a #VLP vaccine targeting #Alzheimers #publishorperish Check it out here: 
News Finding: Therefore, we believe that this report provides compelling evidence that a VLP-based immunotherapy approach can be beneficial in preventing tau pathology and could be applicable to diverse human tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Reported finding: Use of #antipsychotic meds increased among teens &amp; young adults from 2006-2010 but not among kids 12 or younger. 
News Finding: This age profile refines earlier reports of steadily increasing rates of antipsychotic use across multiyear developmental categories of childhood to adolescence 28 to early adulthood.

Reported finding: This meta-analysis confirms that use of #aspirin for primary prevention of #cardiovasculardisease is associated with a lower risk of CV events including CV mortality and nonfatal AMI and #stroke, and an increased risk of major bleeding.  
News Finding: Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (57.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 61.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (hazard ratio CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The use of aspirin in individuals without cardiovascular disease was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of major bleeding.

Sobering findings

The team's results suggest that by the end of the century under a business-as-usual scenario, rainfall in Jordan will decrease by 30 percent, temperatures will increase by 6 degrees Celsius, and the number and duration of droughts will double.
News Finding: The latter two drought types indicate the potential additional manifestations of precipitation deficit, rising temperature, and land-use change.

Reported finding: "In absolute terms, the difference in tax over a year can be considered negligible, but the weight change could be significant, making these changes very cost effective," Sharma says.
News Finding: This means that despite the lower tax burden, the reduction in consumption and body weight is higher under a volumetric tax.

Reported finding: Pretty convincing evidence of negative selection detectable in cancer exomes in contrast to Martincorena et al Cell 2017. Nice eg in TERT w +ve selection in promoter but -ve selection in exons. Makes good sense! 
News Finding: In summary, the presented evidence supports a major role of negative selection in cancer evolution, which has been neglected in most studies, and ultimately challenges the current paradigm of an exclusive role of positive selection in cancer.

Reported finding: "Our results underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with ASD that addresses behavioral, psychological and psychiatric, adaptive, sleep, and medical functioning in order to decrease behavioral crises and the utilization of inpatient psychiatric services," Righi and coauthors write in the study published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders.
News Finding: Overall, our findings emphasize the utility of thorough assessment and treatment of mood and sleep conditions, to decrease the likelihood of requiring psychiatric hospitalization.
