aAn important part of the research was that we showed that in a population from the US, available because of the Human Connectome Project, the orbitofrontal cortex had increased functional connectivity with the other brain regions in people with depressive problems,a co-author and fellow University of Warwick professor Edmund Rolls, Ph.D. tells Inverse, referring to the large-scale effort to map the complete structural and functional neural connections within the human brain. A total of 162 functional connectivity neural links involved in the areas of the brain associated with sleep were identified from these scans. While anyone whoas experienced the difficulty of depression or insomnia may not be surprised that theyare connected, this study marks the first time scientists can definitively say there are neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between the two.""><b>Finding:</b></span> While anyone whoas experienced the difficulty of depression or insomnia may not be surprised that theyare connected, this study marks the first time scientists can definitively say there are neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between the two."				2																					[]	[]	[{'start': 1232, 'end': 1241, 'span': 'connected', 'annotation': 'Correlation'}, {'start': 1352, 'end': 1378, 'span': 'lationship between the two', 'annotation': 'Correlation'}]
