The drinking culture on campus may still make it seem that it is less acceptable for women to drink as much as guysdo, and women who drink a lot may be negatively perceived by other women and men -- this may be why women downplay even heavy drinking by using terms like \"tipsy\" to describe themselves, the researchers suggest.", "Paper Context": "Specifically, moderate intoxication terms were applied to and from women more than men, even when the character was heavily intoxicated, whereas heavy intoxication terms were applied to and from men more than women.
