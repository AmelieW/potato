Among boys in Muslim families, ASD risk was also significantly elevated in those who were circumcised (HR \u00bc 1.54; 95% CI: 1.03-2.31), based on 28 ASD cases in circumcised boys versus 160 cases in intact boys.", "scores": "[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 5.0]", "field": "Psychology", "split": "train", "final_score": 3.5, "source": "news", "News URL": "http://www.science20.com/news_articles/circumcision_linked_to_autism_study-152121", "text": "['<span id=\"hover_text_news\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-html=\"true\" data-placement=\"bottom\" title=\"Context: They found that regardless of cultural background circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing ASD.
