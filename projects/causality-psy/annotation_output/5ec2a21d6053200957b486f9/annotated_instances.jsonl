However, the present study advanced our understanding of VGP as a daily habit of children and revealed that the conditions in which children play videogames for long periods of time may lead to unfavorable neurocognitive development, at least from a certain perspective.\"><b>Finding:</b></span> However, the present study advanced our understanding of VGP as a daily habit of children and revealed that the conditions in which children play videogames for long periods of time may lead to unfavorable neurocognitive development, at least from a certain perspective.", "label_annotations": {"how-causal-is-the-finding": {"Correlation": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 22s "}}
