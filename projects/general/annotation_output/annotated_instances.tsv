Other recommendations from the CPG include:

* Following diagnosis, women with PCOS should be examined for skin and hair complications including excess hair growth and acne;

* Although women with PCOS have some of the same risk factors associated with the development of endometrial cancer, they should not routinely undergo ultrasound screening for endometrial thickness;

* To gauge metabolic risk, adolescents and adult women with PCOS should be screened for increased obesity using body mass index and waist circumference measurements;

* Clinicians should give adolescents and adult women with PCOS an oral glucose tolerance test to check for type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance because they are at increased risk of these conditions; and

CLC-induced IL-1β in macrophages occurred through the activation of caspase-1 following the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, we show that CLCs promoted inflammation in vivo, characterized by neutrophil infiltration, phagocytosis of the crystals, and IL-1β release.""><b>Finding B:</b></span> CLC-induced IL-1β in macrophages occurred through the activation of caspase-1 following the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome."				2
