The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.	"They found that while it was associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, it did lead to an increased risk of major bleeding. The results showed that:

Aspirin use was associated with an 11% lower risk of cardiovascular events. Approximately 250 patients needed to be treated with aspirin for 5 years to prevent a single heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death."	6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0.51% (5% CI, 0.06%-0.3%) for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of 0.64% (5% CI, 0.35%-0.7%) for major bleeding. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude. Aspirin use was not associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, and deaths due to bleeding were rare.

The 5-year cumulative primary outcome event rate was not significantly different between the groups (2.77% [95% CI, 2.40%-3.20%] for aspirin vs 2.96% [95% CI, 2.58%-3.40%] for no aspirin; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77-1.15]; P = .54).	The researchers found that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in time to the primary end point (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal heart attack).

The researchers found that 58 percent of nurses gave their hospitals an unfavorable evaluation of end-of-life care overall and 53 percent reported that patients often experience painful procedures that were unlikely to change their outcome. The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care. Compared to nurses in poor-quality environments, nurses in the best environments were less likely to rate their hospital's overall end-of-life care quality unfavorably (odds ratio, 0.45).	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment. Nurses in the best environments were 55% less likely than nurses in poor environments to rate their hospital's overall end-oflife care quality unfavorably (odds ratio = 0.45; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.52; P < .001).
