10.1126/sciadv.aau2477	Medicine_538	Almost 26 cubic kilometers of floodwater was temporarily stored on land, evaporating (or transpiring through plant leaves) much more slowly at about one cubic kilometer per day.	Inversion of these data shows that a third of Harvey's total stormwater was captured on land (25.7 ± .0 km ), indicating that the rest drained rapidly into the ocean at a rate of 8.2 km	That's far more water than was captured by stations measuring river flow, showing that much of the water either did not drain through major channels or entered those channels downstream of the last measuring station. Almost 26 cubic kilometers of floodwater was temporarily stored on land, evaporating (or transpiring through plant leaves) much more slowly at about one cubic kilometer per day. It took five weeks for the GPS measurements to return to their pre-Harvey state, bouncing back as the land was relieved of the excess water's weight.	Water left in Harvey's wake should cause elastic loading and subsidence of Earth's crust, and uplift as it drains into the ocean and evaporates. Inversion of these data shows that a third of Harvey's total stormwater was captured on land (25.7 ± .0 km ), indicating that the rest drained rapidly into the ocean at a rate of 8.2 km Over a period of 7 days, Harvey produced record-breaking rainfall, with 1.54 m of precipitation measured southeast of Houston, causing extensive flooding and $125 billion in damage, an amount second only to Hurricane Katrina .

"	Unlike other BMP family members, BMP9 is not effected by BMP antagonists such as Noggin 12 which suppresses BMP signaling and is necessary for joint morphogenesis . We show here that Bmp9 is transiently expressed during digit joint cavitation and that BMP9 treatment stimulates joint regeneration. During angiogenesis, BMP9 acts in a contextdependent manner, inhibiting neovascularization in a model of age-related macular degeneration , while stimulating angiogenesis associated with induced osteogenesis .
