Trainees in clinic associated w longer appointment times, even for patients not seen by a trainee. 	Findings In this single-center cohort study of 49 448 outpatient ophthalmology appointments by 33 attending physicians, appointments with residents and fellows were 32% and 30% longer, respectively, than appointments without trainees. The presence of a trainee in a clinic session was associated with longer mean appointment times, even in appointments in which the trainee was not present. Meaning Academic medical centers face potential challenges in maintaining clinical efficiency and medical education, particularly in emerging value-based reimbursement models.

At the intensively monitored site, illegal killing increased markedly after 2008 and was correlated strongly with the local black market ivory price and increased seizures of ivory destined for China.	This surge was directly correlated to a more than quadrupling of local black-market ivory prices paid to poachers and tripling in the volume and number of illegal ivory seizures through Kenyan ports of transit. The data also show that the destination of the illegally trafficked ivory increasingly shifted to China. Such figures cause conservationists alarm, as the study shows over 54 percent is a level of poaching that elephant birth rates are unable to overcome and will lead to population decline.	At the intensively monitored site, illegal killing increased markedly after 2008 and was correlated strongly with the local black market ivory price and increased seizures of ivory destined for China. More broadly, results from application to continental data indicated illegal killing levels were unsustainable for the species between 2010 and 2012, peaking to ∼8% in 2011 which extrapolates to ∼40,000 elephants illegally killed and a probable species reduction of ∼3% that year. Preliminary data from 2013 indicate overharvesting continued.

A new study on dog behavior may help us better understand how human personalities affect obesity. The scientists thought that the obese dogs would be more likely to wait for the potential high-value meal, that they would do anything for something big and tasty. However, that was not the case.	Our results also confirm that overweight dogs, as opposed to normal weight dogs, tried to maximize food intake from the higher quality food and hesitated to do the task when the food reward was uncertain.

While we found evidence that populations with limited mobility (such as Medicare beneficiaries younger than age sixty-five and people with selfreported physical or mental health concerns that limit their activities) were among the highest users, key underserved populations (including Medicaid, low-income, and rural populations) had significantly lower use of telehealth.

Compared to those who didn't take aspirin, aspirin use was associated with a 43 percent increase of major bleeding events. In other words, researchers wrote, approximately one in 200 people treated with aspirin would experience significant bleeding. To prevent a single heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death, approximately 250 patients needed to be treated with the drug for five years.	However, the use of cardiovascular risk scores tends to overestimate an individual's true risk, 32 with poor agreement between different cardiovascular risk calculators. 6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0.51% (5% CI, 0.06%-0.3%) for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of 0.64% (5% CI, 0.35%-0.7%) for major bleeding. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.

In all three cities, new cases of autism were identified by the study in mainstream schools, reflecting current under-diagnosis.	"In Shenzhen and Jiamusi cities, only data for children in mainstream education was available; in Shenzhen City, 42 out of every 10,000 children in mainstream education had autism, and in Jiamusi City this figure was 19 per 10,000. In all three cities, the researchers identified new cases of autism in mainstream schools, confirming that there is under-diagnosis of autism in China. ""Contrary to previous studies, we have shown that the prevalence of autism spectrum conditions in China is in line with that found in the West,"" said Dr Sophia Xiang Sun, who conducted this study as part of her PhD at Cambridge University and who is now based in the Star Kay Bridge Research Centre for Children with Autism in Xiamen, China."	Results from Shenzhen and Jiamusi cities, where only mainstream data were available, prevalence is also in line with Western estimates. In all three cities, new cases of autism were identified by the study in mainstream schools, reflecting current under-diagnosis.
