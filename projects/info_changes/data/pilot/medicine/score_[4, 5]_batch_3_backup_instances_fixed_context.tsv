While the presence of P. gingivalis was not significantly associated with age, gender, or smoking history of the patients, the presence of P. gingivalis was positively related to differentiation, lymph node metastasis and the TNM stage of ESCC (p < 0.05).	P. gingivalis linked to esophageal cancer. 	If we set the samples with IHC scores more than 1 as P. gingivalis positive, the sensitivity and specificity of IHC would be 94.3 and 96.6 %, respectively (Kappa = 0.882; p < 0.001, Additional file 2: Table S1), showing excellence concordance between IHC and qRT-PCR for the detection of P. gingivalis infection in the cancerous tissues of ESCC patients. While the presence of P. gingivalis was not significantly associated with age, gender, or smoking history of the patients, the presence of P. gingivalis was positively related to differentiation, lymph node metastasis and the TNM stage of ESCC (p < 0.05). A positive immunohistochemical signal for P. gingivalis was 90 % in the poorly differentiated tissues, which was significantly higher than that of well or moderately differentiated samples (p < 0.05) ( Table 5) .

Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.	At higher doses, any differences between women who took vitamin D and those who didn't were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance. Taking vitamin D during pregnancy was safe, with no extra fetal or neonatal mortality, congenital abnormality, or critical illness at birth, said senior author Dr. Shu Qin Wei of the University of Montreal, Canada.

Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.
