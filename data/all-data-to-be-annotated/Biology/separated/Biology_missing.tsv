The other regions displaying juice and VTA-EM activations were mainly somatosensory and motor and/or premotor regions (areas 1 and 2, area 3a and 3b, frontal area 1 [F], F3, F5a, F5c, rostral inferior parietal lobule [PF] , and secondary somatosensory cortex [SII] ).	Subsequent repetition of the preference test showed that the animal's choice had shifted to the image reinforced by VTA stimulation. Functional MR imaging taken while the animals received either a juice reward or VTA stimulation revealed that both induced activation of brain regions that previous studies in humans and other primates have associated with reward signaling by means of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The level of VTA stimulation required to activate these structures was considerably less than the amount required to reinforce or change behavior in the earlier experiments.	This correspondence confirms that VTA-EM activates most of the structures typically activated by natural reinforcers. The other regions displaying juice and VTA-EM activations were mainly somatosensory and motor and/or premotor regions (areas 1 and 2, area 3a and 3b, frontal area 1 [F], F3, F5a, F5c, rostral inferior parietal lobule [PF] , and secondary somatosensory cortex [SII] ). Although activation of these structures in the juice experiment could result from the motor component of juice consumption, there were no differences in the juice administered temporally surrounding VTA-EM and the no VTA-EM events (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

The index provides a valuable new tool to conservationists and park managers committed to preserving coral reefs and scientists interested in learning more about the hundreds of reef-building corals. ""In our study, we observed a widely variable bleaching and mortality response among corals,"" Marcelino says.

Within a bleaching event, coral susceptibility to stress is highly uneven. Coral colonies, inhabiting the same reef and apparently exposed to identical conditions, will bleach and die at different rates Obura, 2001; .

Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	Because biomass dynamics of lianas are included in the whole-forest estimates, our findings corroborate earlier research that lianas themselves do not compensate for the loss in tree biomass that they cause .
