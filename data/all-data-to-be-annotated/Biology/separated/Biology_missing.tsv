Trade offs in marine protection: Higher #lobster numbers in a #MarineReserve reduced other crustacean species  	Interestingly, catches of adult lobsters were inversely correlated with those of juvenile lobsters, brown crabs, and velvet crabs, which may be evidence of competitive displacement and/or predation. Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others. If populations are to benefit from the protection afforded by MPAs, it is necessary that a number of individuals spend a substantial part of their lives within their boundaries .

The authors found that the diabetes drug metformin corrected the low levels of fatty acid oxidation seen in cells expressing the KSR2 mutations.

10.1186/s40168-015-0071-z	Biology_40_r	The study found that, on average, Bifidobacterium were established earlier and more frequently in infants fed by women with an active copy of the gene, the secretors, than without one, the non-secretors.	Bifidobacteria were found to be established (High-Bif qPCR ) earlier in secretorfed infants (60% of infants versus 37.5% at day 6) and more often (80% versus 50% by day 120) ( Figure 5 ).	The relationship between human genetics, breast milk and Bifidobacterium appears to have developed throughout mammalian evolution. The study found that, on average, Bifidobacterium were established earlier and more frequently in infants fed by women with an active copy of the gene, the secretors, than without one, the non-secretors. The authors found that the intestinal tracts of infants fed by non-secretor mothers are delayed in establishing a bifidobacteria-dominated microbiota.	Much of the bifidobacterial abundance difference between the two secretor status milk phenotypes appears to come from variation in the time at which each infant transitions from possessing a Low-Bif qPCR ' gut community to possessing a High-Bif qPCR gut community.

While we demonstrate that amphibian communities are sensitive to changes in climate, our results suggest that changing climate is not the proximate cause for ongoing assemblage-wide declines that have been observed in North American amphibians.	"For example, they found that less precipitation during breeding seasons generally has a negative effect on amphibian populations, while less snowfall during winter may benefit many populations. The researchers determined that, while climate change likely has been and will be a factor in the decline of some local populations such as in the Rocky Mountain West -- where the effect of a warming climate seems to be more severe for amphibians -- it is not responsible for the current declines that are occurring. ""It depends on the location whether habitat loss, disease, contaminants, climate, or a combination of these local factors is the culprit,"" she said."	For example, we found that summer drought has the strongest impact in warm and dry regions, decreased snowfall has a smaller effect in eastern compared to western North America, and winter warming is predicted to decrease species richness for all species groups except tree frogs. While we demonstrate that amphibian communities are sensitive to changes in climate, our results suggest that changing climate is not the proximate cause for ongoing assemblage-wide declines that have been observed in North American amphibians. Instead, we find that recent change in climate is a strong predictor of why local species richness is declining more quickly in some regions and that positive effects of climate may be buffering declines in other regions.

All these relations together form a robust network of interactions between plants and pollinators. These networks have a characteristic structure that is similar in very different natural landscapes, such as rainforests and river deltas, as well as in human-dominated landscapes with orchards, fields and meadows. Plants and pollinators take a position within those networks that makes the benefit from their mutual relationships for each species individually, and for all plants and pollinators together, as large as possible.	Our results can be understood intuitively by considering the 'net effects' of species on each other and the way in which these effects are mediated by the topology of mutualistic networks. The extent to which pollinators interact with the same plant species increases with connectance and/or nestedeness. A high nestedness of the mutualistic network may therefore promote the occurrence of indirect positive effects between pollinators.

All these relations together form a robust network of interactions between plants and pollinators. These networks have a characteristic structure that is similar in very different natural landscapes, such as rainforests and river deltas, as well as in human-dominated landscapes with orchards, fields and meadows. Plants and pollinators take a position within those networks that makes the benefit from their mutual relationships for each species individually, and for all plants and pollinators together, as large as possible.	Our results can be understood intuitively by considering the 'net effects' of species on each other and the way in which these effects are mediated by the topology of mutualistic networks. The extent to which pollinators interact with the same plant species increases with connectance and/or nestedeness. A high nestedness of the mutualistic network may therefore promote the occurrence of indirect positive effects between pollinators.

Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal. This point is confirmed by our inclusion of lianas in the biomass calculations in the control plots.

Darwin's dilemma resolved - high rates of evolution in Cambrian explosion consistent with natural selection: 	Phenotypic traits diverge at 1.17% pMyr in the early Cambrian, w83 the average rate for the remainder of the Phanerozoic (0.139% pMyr); molecular divergence is 0.204% pMyr, w93 the subsequent rate (0.021%). This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates. The 4-and 5.5-fold increases in phenotypic and molecular evolutionary rates respectively provide quantitative support for the widespread view that evolutionary rates were elevated during the Cambrian explosion.
