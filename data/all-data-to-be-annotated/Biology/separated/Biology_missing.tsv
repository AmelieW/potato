The researchers determined that more infants fed by secretor mothers had high levels of bifidobacteria -- 60 percent of infants versus 37.5 percent at day 6 and 80 percent versus 50 percent at day 120 -- and that infants who had more bifidobacteria had lower amounts of milk sugars left over and higher amounts of lactate in their feces."	Bifidobacteria were found to be established (High-Bif qPCR ) earlier in secretorfed infants (60% of infants versus 37.5% at day 6) and more often (80% versus 50% by day 120) ( Figure 5 ).	"The delay, the authors said, may be due to difficulties in the infant acquiring a species of bifidobacteria that is geared toward consuming the specific milk sugar delivered by the mother. advertisement

Much of the bifidobacterial abundance difference between the two secretor status milk phenotypes appears to come from variation in the time at which each infant transitions from possessing a Low-Bif qPCR ' gut community to possessing a High-Bif qPCR gut community.

10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.013	Biology_239_r	The researchers also found that a bacterial protein called BBK32 helps to stabilize and strengthen the bonds between the bacteria and the blood vessel wall.	Although these data showed that BBK32 stabilizes B. burgdorferi-endothelial interactions and extends the force and shear stress range at which they occur by a catch bond mechanism, many questions remain.	The researchers found that the way B. burgdorferi moves inside blood vessels can be likened to a child swinging on monkey bars: The bacteria form bonds with the blood vessel wall, and then move by transferring force from one bond to the next, but never completely detaching from the blood vessel wall. The researchers also found that a bacterial protein called BBK32 helps to stabilize and strengthen the bonds between the bacteria and the blood vessel wall. Drugs that target BBK32 might help to prevent the spread of B. burgdorferi to joints, the heart and the nervous system, although future research is needed to test this, the researchers said.	The BBK32 catch bond force regime ranged from ~2 to 19 pN and was similar to the catch bond force regimes of selectins (~5-50 pN), which are the major molecular mediators of leukocyte rolling at the PCV shear stress range . Although these data showed that BBK32 stabilizes B. burgdorferi-endothelial interactions and extends the force and shear stress range at which they occur by a catch bond mechanism, many questions remain. Thus, multiple BBK32 ligand-binding sites could potentially form or reciprocally regulate catch bond formation.

NO's effect is manifested in losers by prolonged avoidance behavior, characteristic for social defeat in numerous species.	They found that nitric oxide induces a flight response, which tells the losing cricket when enough is enough and it is time to run away from its aggressor. Stevenson and Rillich found that compared with the crickets treated with nitric oxide suppressing drugs which tend to fight longer and have escalated aggression, the crickets treated with nitric oxide did not fight as long nor do they have escalated violence. The observations suggest that deciding to flee from a conflict is influenced by nitric oxide that involuntarily acts on the nervous system.	Rather than suppressing aggressive motivation, NO increases susceptibility to aversive stimuli and with it the likelihood to flee. NO's effect is manifested in losers by prolonged avoidance behavior, characteristic for social defeat in numerous species.

10.1073/pnas.1504869112	Biology_116_r	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death.	Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	Because biomass dynamics of lianas are included in the whole-forest estimates, our findings corroborate earlier research that lianas themselves do not compensate for the loss in tree biomass that they cause . Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.
