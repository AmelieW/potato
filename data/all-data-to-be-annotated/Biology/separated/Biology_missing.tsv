The researchers determined that more infants fed by secretor mothers had high levels of bifidobacteria -- 60 percent of infants versus 37.5 percent at day 6 and 80 percent versus 50 percent at day 120 -- and that infants who had more bifidobacteria had lower amounts of milk sugars left over and higher amounts of lactate in their feces."	Bifidobacteria were found to be established (High-Bif qPCR ) earlier in secretorfed infants (60% of infants versus 37.5% at day 6) and more often (80% versus 50% by day 120) ( Figure 5 ).	"The delay, the authors said, may be due to difficulties in the infant acquiring a species of bifidobacteria that is geared toward consuming the specific milk sugar delivered by the mother. advertisement

Much of the bifidobacterial abundance difference between the two secretor status milk phenotypes appears to come from variation in the time at which each infant transitions from possessing a Low-Bif qPCR ' gut community to possessing a High-Bif qPCR gut community.

As long as the scientists allowed only the bacteria to evolve in their experiments and computer simulations, the bacteria were able to protect themselves well from being eaten - with acceptable effort. However, as soon as the ciliates were also allowed to evolve, protection came at a high cost to the bacteria: they then only produced few offspring.

The other regions displaying juice and VTA-EM activations were mainly somatosensory and motor and/or premotor regions (areas 1 and 2, area 3a and 3b, frontal area 1 [F], F3, F5a, F5c, rostral inferior parietal lobule [PF] , and secondary somatosensory cortex [SII] ).	Subsequent repetition of the preference test showed that the animal's choice had shifted to the image reinforced by VTA stimulation. Functional MR imaging taken while the animals received either a juice reward or VTA stimulation revealed that both induced activation of brain regions that previous studies in humans and other primates have associated with reward signaling by means of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The level of VTA stimulation required to activate these structures was considerably less than the amount required to reinforce or change behavior in the earlier experiments.	This correspondence confirms that VTA-EM activates most of the structures typically activated by natural reinforcers. The other regions displaying juice and VTA-EM activations were mainly somatosensory and motor and/or premotor regions (areas 1 and 2, area 3a and 3b, frontal area 1 [F], F3, F5a, F5c, rostral inferior parietal lobule [PF] , and secondary somatosensory cortex [SII] ).

10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.013	Biology_239_r	The researchers also found that a bacterial protein called BBK32 helps to stabilize and strengthen the bonds between the bacteria and the blood vessel wall.	Although these data showed that BBK32 stabilizes B. burgdorferi-endothelial interactions and extends the force and shear stress range at which they occur by a catch bond mechanism, many questions remain.	The researchers found that the way B. burgdorferi moves inside blood vessels can be likened to a child swinging on monkey bars: The bacteria form bonds with the blood vessel wall, and then move by transferring force from one bond to the next, but never completely detaching from the blood vessel wall. The researchers also found that a bacterial protein called BBK32 helps to stabilize and strengthen the bonds between the bacteria and the blood vessel wall. Drugs that target BBK32 might help to prevent the spread of B. burgdorferi to joints, the heart and the nervous system, although future research is needed to test this, the researchers said.	The BBK32 catch bond force regime ranged from ~2 to 19 pN and was similar to the catch bond force regimes of selectins (~5-50 pN), which are the major molecular mediators of leukocyte rolling at the PCV shear stress range . Although these data showed that BBK32 stabilizes B. burgdorferi-endothelial interactions and extends the force and shear stress range at which they occur by a catch bond mechanism, many questions remain. Thus, multiple BBK32 ligand-binding sites could potentially form or reciprocally regulate catch bond formation.

""It suggests that over the decades to come, lianas could increasingly suppress the ability of tropical forests to sequester carbon."""	The increase in lianas, combined with the observations that lianas can reduce individual tree growth by up to 84% and increase tree mortality risk two-to three-fold , has made it pertinent to investigate the effect of lianas on forest-level biomass dynamics to better predict the effect of increasing liana abundance on tropical forests. These studies indicated that the presence of lianas can reduce stand-level biomass growth by ∼10% and net forest biomass accumulation by up to 18% and that forest carbon stocks decrease with increasing liana abundance ( .

Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	Because biomass dynamics of lianas are included in the whole-forest estimates, our findings corroborate earlier research that lianas themselves do not compensate for the loss in tree biomass that they cause . Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal. This point is confirmed by our inclusion of lianas in the biomass calculations in the control plots.

Darwin's dilemma resolved - high rates of evolution in Cambrian explosion consistent with natural selection: 	Phenotypic traits diverge at 1.17% pMyr in the early Cambrian, w83 the average rate for the remainder of the Phanerozoic (0.139% pMyr); molecular divergence is 0.204% pMyr, w93 the subsequent rate (0.021%). This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates. The 4-and 5.5-fold increases in phenotypic and molecular evolutionary rates respectively provide quantitative support for the widespread view that evolutionary rates were elevated during the Cambrian explosion.
