Synthetic self-propelled swimming bio-bots:  (powered by cardiomyocytes) 	Although only cardiomyocytes are used as contractile cells in this work, the method is applicable to other homotypic cell types, such as optogenetic muscle cells for light-actuated swimming, or heterotypic cells types, such as turtle cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts for room temperature swimming, and neurons and muscle cells for sensing-based intelligent swimming. The study thus provides a foundation for a new class of self-propelled, batch-fabricable, soft biological swimming machines.

Therefore, differences in DNA methylation correlate with the X chromosome status of iPSCs.	Note: material may have been edited for length and content. For further information, please contact the cited source. X Chromosome Dosage Influences DNA Methylation Dynamics during Reprogramming to Mouse iPSCs.	Specifically, iPSCs and ESCs clustered into two main groups ( Figure 1D ). Therefore, differences in DNA methylation correlate with the X chromosome status of iPSCs. These data suggested that the first principal component, which correlated with the number of active X chromosomes and captured the separation of XO/XY and XX ESCs/iPSCs as well as most variation in methylation ( Figure 1D ), corresponded to the previously described global difference in methylation between established male and female PSCs or XO and XX female PSCs (Choi et al., , 2017a .

10.1073/pnas.1504869112	Biology_116_r	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death.	Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	Because biomass dynamics of lianas are included in the whole-forest estimates, our findings corroborate earlier research that lianas themselves do not compensate for the loss in tree biomass that they cause . Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.

Darwin's dilemma resolved - high rates of evolution in Cambrian explosion consistent with natural selection: 	Phenotypic traits diverge at 1.17% pMyr in the early Cambrian, w83 the average rate for the remainder of the Phanerozoic (0.139% pMyr); molecular divergence is 0.204% pMyr, w93 the subsequent rate (0.021%). This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates.
