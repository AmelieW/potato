10.1016/j.cub.2018.06.016	Biology_170_r	As the project progressed, fish were exposed to non-fish objects, which failed to initiate social orienting.	We conclude from these results that another socially engaged fish is the stimulus required for social orienting and that the presence of another fish that is not socially engaged is insufficient regardless of their proximity.	Expecting to see behavioral disruptions in the drugged fish, which the researchers did, they also saw reduced orienting behaviors by the healthy fish. As the project progressed, fish were exposed to non-fish objects, which failed to initiate social orienting. Eventually, the research team concluded that zebrafish copy each other's motions and are dependent on another socially engaged fish to begin social orienting.	We placed apo-treated fish in a shortened tank that restricted their movement away from the divider and found that test fish exposed to apo-treated stimulus fish still had suppressed social orienting relative to controls (Figures  2A-2D ; p = 0.009, n = 26). We conclude from these results that another socially engaged fish is the stimulus required for social orienting and that the presence of another fish that is not socially engaged is insufficient regardless of their proximity. Orientation of the test fish and distance of the stimulus fish are highly correlated (R 2 = 0.302, p < 0.001), as is the orienting behavior of the stimulus fish (R 2 = 0.458, p < 0.001; Figures 2E and 2F ).

Our custom imagers and incubators are included in BioBits‚Ñ¢ Bright, making reaction analysis accessible for resourcelimited classrooms.	"The BioBits kits introduce molecular and synthetic biology concepts without the need for specialized lab equipment, at a fraction of the cost of current standard experimental designs. The FD-CF reactions pioneered in Collins' lab for molecular manufacturing, when combined with innovations from the lab of Michael Jewett, Ph.D. at Northwestern University, offer a solution to this problem by removing bacteria from the equation altogether. ""Challenging the students to build their own in vitro synthetic programs also allows educators to start to talk about how synthetic biologists might control biology to make important products, such as medicines or chemicals,"" explained Jessica Stark, an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Jewett lab at Northwestern University who is co-first author on both papers."	This is made possible by our in-house freeze-dried reactions, which are two orders of magnitude more affordable than existing commercial cell-free kits, at just ~US$0.01 per microliter of reaction volume (table S3) compared to ~US$1 per microliter (Promega L110; NEB E6800S). Our custom imagers and incubators are included in BioBits‚Ñ¢ Bright, making reaction analysis accessible for resourcelimited classrooms. Because of the highly portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly nature of the reagents and laboratory activities, the BioBits‚Ñ¢ Bright and Explorer kits have utility both inside and outside of a formal classroom or laboratory setting.
