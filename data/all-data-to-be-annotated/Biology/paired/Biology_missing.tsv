Darwin's dilemma resolved - high rates of evolution in Cambrian explosion consistent with natural selection: 	Phenotypic traits diverge at 1.17% pMyr in the early Cambrian, w83 the average rate for the remainder of the Phanerozoic (0.139% pMyr); molecular divergence is 0.204% pMyr, w93 the subsequent rate (0.021%). This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates. The 4-and 5.5-fold increases in phenotypic and molecular evolutionary rates respectively provide quantitative support for the widespread view that evolutionary rates were elevated during the Cambrian explosion.

Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	Because biomass dynamics of lianas are included in the whole-forest estimates, our findings corroborate earlier research that lianas themselves do not compensate for the loss in tree biomass that they cause .

Regulation of energy metabolism by Ago2 provides a novel paradigm in which RNA silencing plays an integral role in determining basal metabolic activity in #obesity associated sequelae #NASH #diabetes 	Upon loading of Ago proteins with mature miRNAs produced by the endoribonuclease Dicer 18 , RISC represses the expression of targeted mRNA through RNA silencing .
