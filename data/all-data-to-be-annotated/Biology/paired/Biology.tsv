The association between a terrestrial lifestyle and the loss/reduction of adhesion suggests a direct link between morphology, biomechanics, and ecology. Generally, across the tree of life, we might expect that many of the most extraordinary examples of adaptive divergence should coincide not only with the origin and retention of innovations but also with their simplification, and ultimately their loss, in association with adaptation to new situations. The increase in the rate of evolutionary change in these situations suggests that the origin of an elongate body likely led not only to relaxed selection for the retention of limbs, but also to rapid adaptive selection, favoring both their loss and other associated morphological changes.

While we demonstrate that amphibian communities are sensitive to changes in climate, our results suggest that changing climate is not the proximate cause for ongoing assemblage-wide declines that have been observed in North American amphibians.	"For example, they found that less precipitation during breeding seasons generally has a negative effect on amphibian populations, while less snowfall during winter may benefit many populations.

For example, we found that summer drought has the strongest impact in warm and dry regions, decreased snowfall has a smaller effect in eastern compared to western North America, and winter warming is predicted to decrease species richness for all species groups except tree frogs. While we demonstrate that amphibian communities are sensitive to changes in climate, our results suggest that changing climate is not the proximate cause for ongoing assemblage-wide declines that have been observed in North American amphibians.

Therefore, differences in DNA methylation correlate with the X chromosome status of iPSCs.	Note: material may have been edited for length and content. For further information, please contact the cited source. X Chromosome Dosage Influences DNA Methylation Dynamics during Reprogramming to Mouse iPSCs.	Specifically, iPSCs and ESCs clustered into two main groups ( Figure 1D ). Therefore, differences in DNA methylation correlate with the X chromosome status of iPSCs. These data suggested that the first principal component, which correlated with the number of active X chromosomes and captured the separation of XO/XY and XX ESCs/iPSCs as well as most variation in methylation ( Figure 1D ), corresponded to the previously described global difference in methylation between established male and female PSCs or XO and XX female PSCs (Choi et al., , 2017a .

10.1073/pnas.1504869112	Biology_116	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death.	Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	Because biomass dynamics of lianas are included in the whole-forest estimates, our findings corroborate earlier research that lianas themselves do not compensate for the loss in tree biomass that they cause . Lianas, per-unit biomass, have a much stronger competitive effect on trees than do other trees (3), and our findings appear to represent the unique effect of lianas on forest carbon dynamics and not merely the effect of biomass removal.

Darwin's dilemma resolved - high rates of evolution in Cambrian explosion consistent with natural selection: 	Phenotypic traits diverge at 1.17% pMyr in the early Cambrian, w83 the average rate for the remainder of the Phanerozoic (0.139% pMyr); molecular divergence is 0.204% pMyr, w93 the subsequent rate (0.021%). This study provides the first explicit estimates of rates of both phenotypic and molecular evolution during the Cambrian explosion, permitting illuminating comparisons with later Phanerozoic rates. The 4-and 5.5-fold increases in phenotypic and molecular evolutionary rates respectively provide quantitative support for the widespread view that evolutionary rates were elevated during the Cambrian explosion.
