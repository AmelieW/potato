Furthermore, dogs followed the actor's gaze significantly less in the BC compared to the O condition [cumulative accuracy, two-sample t test, t(24) = 22.107, p = 0.045].

Immune dysfunction in autism. Pathophysiological pathways. 	Furthermore, these dysfunctional immune responses are associated with increased impairments in behaviors characteristic of core features of ASD, in particular, deficits in social interactions and communication. This review will discuss the current state of our knowledge of immune dysfunction in ASD, how these findings may impact on underlying neuro-immune mechanisms and implicate potential areas where the manipulation of the immune response could have an impact on behavior and immunity in ASD. There is a concordance rate for ASD of 0-37% reported for dizygotic twins, while concordance rates of 44-91% are reported for monozygotic twins (Bailey et al., 1995; Constantino and Todd, 2000; Kates et al., 2004; Steffenburg et al., 1989) , suggesting that genetic composition may contribute to increased risk of developing ASD.

Our results showed that most of the official adult-onset men began their antisocial activities during early childhood.	Using this unusually rich source of data, the study was able to look at childhood history compared with adult behavior. Beckley, who is in the department of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, said the adult-onset group had a history of anti-social behavior back to childhood, but reported committing relatively fewer crimes. This group reported committing more crimes than folks who had never been convicted, but fewer crimes than people who had been in trouble as juveniles.	Our results, along with past research (see, for example, , indicate that as a whole, apparent adult-onset offenders are responsible for a small minority of total crime. Our results showed that most of the official adult-onset men began their antisocial activities during early childhood. In fact, on average, official adult-onset men were similar to juvenile-onset men on multiple measures of child and adolescent antisocial behavior.

Results In all, 19% of participants (n = 134) reported physical dating violence perpetration and 68% reported experiencing corporal punishment as children (n = 498).	Of the 758 young adults recruited for the study, 61 percent were female. In total,19 percent of the young volunteers involved in the study reported that they had been physically abusive to a partner during a dating relationship and 68 percent of the volunteers reported to experiencing corporal punishment as children. There was a positive relationship between corporal punishment and physical violence during a romantic relationship.	Results In all, 19% of participants (n = 134) reported physical dating violence perpetration and 68% reported experiencing corporal punishment as children (n = 498). Analysis showed a significant positive association between corporal punishment and physical perpetration of dating violence (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.59). Even after controlling for sex, ethnicity, age, parental education, and child physical abuse, childhood corporal punishment was associated significantly with physical dating violence perpetration (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.62).
