Ritual circumcision among Danish boys is linked to an overall 46-62% increase in ASD risk in the first 10 years of life, with the upper risk estimate obtained after restriction to the period with the most complete data.

Further, a mediation analysis showed that the functional connectivity links between the brain areas identified played a significant role in the association of depressive problems with poor sleep quality.	In the brains of those living with depressive problems, they discovered a strong connection between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with short-term memory), the precuneus (associated with the self), and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (associated with negative emotion). The analysis showed that these functional connectivities underlie the relation between depressive problems and sleep quality. The researchers conclude that increased functional connectivity among these brain regions provides a neural basis for how depression is related to poor sleep quality.	The results show that both poor sleep quality and depressive problems are significantly positively correlated with functional connectivities involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, and the precuneus.

About half of all independent transitions to paternal care have occurred in instances where social monogamy was already established, whereas the evolution of paternal care occurred on the same branch as a transition to social monogamy in the other cases.	They showed that nine per cent of mammals are socially monogamous, including a few rodents, a number of primates, and some carnivores, like jackals, wolves, and meerkats. This study shows that paternal care usually evolved after monogamy was already present. This advance in understanding was, says Lukas, due to the volume of information they collected and the availability of genetic information that allowed the researchers to determine the sequence in which different traits evolved.	Although paternal care and social monogamy are associated, an analysis of transitions suggests that male care is probably a consequence rather than a cause of the evolution of social monogamy. About half of all independent transitions to paternal care have occurred in instances where social monogamy was already established, whereas the evolution of paternal care occurred on the same branch as a transition to social monogamy in the other cases. Inferences from BayesTraits' models indicate that paternal care is a secondary adaptation, because transitions to social monogamy are inferred to occur first on branches where both traits evolved separately (lrt P = 0.002; table S2).

In the brains of those living with depressive problems, they discovered a strong connection between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with short-term memory), the precuneus (associated with the self), and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (associated with negative emotion).

Our study confirms and extends findings from previous longitudinal studies of post-infective fatigue syndrome, which have observed greater fatigue at initial presentation to clinics, around four weeks post-infection, in those who would go on to experience persistent fatigue VollmerConna et al., 2007) .	Those 18 patients had a much stronger immune response during treatment with interferon-alpha, with a doubling in the levels of immune system messenger molecules called interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, according to the report. Even before treatment started, levels of interleukin-10 were higher among the 18 patients who later developed long-term fatigue, suggesting the immune system may have been primed to overreact, the study authors explained. Yet, there was no difference before treatments between the groups in their levels of fatigue or in psychiatric symptoms, like depression or recent stressful events, the scientists noted.	Of note, PF is not due to worse recovery from the effects of IFN-α treatment per se, since the changes in clinical symptoms over the sixmonths post-treatment reveal a similar rate of recovery in both the PF and the RF groups. Our study confirms and extends findings from previous longitudinal studies of post-infective fatigue syndrome, which have observed greater fatigue at initial presentation to clinics, around four weeks post-infection, in those who would go on to experience persistent fatigue VollmerConna et al., 2007) . Interestingly, by adding a 'baseline' assessment before IFN-α (i.e., equivalent to a hitherto unavailable fatigue measurement before the infection), our study shows that pre-treatment levels of fatigue are not a good predictor of the development of CFS in response to an immune challenge.

""The findings support the proposition that early adolescent attempts to gain status via pseudomature behavior are not simply passing annoyances of this developmental stage, but rather may signal movement down a problematic pathway and away from progress toward real psychosocial competence."""	This finding indicates just how potentially important this social pathway toward future difficulties may be in identifying individuals at risk for long-term problems with alcohol and substance use.	"By the time these ""cool"" kids turned 23, many of them were having problems with criminal behavior and alcohol and marijuana use -- significantly more than the other subjects in the study, who were not ranked in the ""cool"" category at the study's onset. The researchers conclude with this scary notion:

""The findings support the proposition that early adolescent attempts to gain status via pseudomature behavior are not simply passing annoyances of this developmental stage, but rather may signal movement down a problematic pathway and away from progress toward real psychosocial competence."" In other words, if you're acting extreme to look cool, chances are good that you might be the only one who thinks so."	In fact, after accounting for pseudomature behavior, early adolescent levels of substance use became insignificant as predictors of future use, suggesting that to the extent that pseudomature behavior and substance use were correlated in early adolescence, it was pseudomature behavior that took on the primary role in statistically predicting future substance use -a striking degree of heterotypic continuity for a behavior that typically displays considerable homotypic continuity over time . This finding indicates just how potentially important this social pathway toward future difficulties may be in identifying individuals at risk for long-term problems with alcohol and substance use. These findings also suggest that the constellation of pseudomature behaviors examined was capturing something other than a simple propensity toward deviant behavior.

The study's findings showed that, regardless of cultural background, circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing ASD. The researchers noted they also made an unexpected observation of an increased risk of hyperactivity disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families. While it is unacceptable today to circumcise boys without proper pain relief, there is no way to eliminate the pain completely, the researchers said, adding that some boys will endure a lot of pain.	More strikingly, risk was 80-83% increased in the first 0-4 years of life, an increase that was restricted to infantile autism. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence to suggest a link between circumcision and hyperactivity disorder, so our finding of an increased risk of this common neurobehavioral disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families was unexpected and needs cautious interpretation. As expected, risk of asthma was independent of the boys' foreskin status, which is in accordance with prior findings for asthma in the first years of life.

The increased risk of ASD in circumcised boys under the age of 5 years was present among boys in both Muslim and non-Muslim families ( Table 2) .	The researchers, who followed the boys up to the age of nine, found that almost 5,000 cases of ASD were diagnosed. The study's findings showed that, regardless of cultural background, circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing ASD. The researchers noted they also made an unexpected observation of an increased risk of hyperactivity disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families.	The HR was higher, though not significantly so, for boys circumcised at age 24 months or older (HR ¼ 1.96; 95% CI: 0.93-4.14), an estimate based on only seven cases of ASD in that group ( Table 2) . The increased risk of ASD in circumcised boys under the age of 5 years was present among boys in both Muslim and non-Muslim families ( Table 2) . Risk in this age group was markedly elevated among boys in non-Muslim families (HR ¼ 4.23; 95% CI: 1.90-9.44), a finding based on six ASD cases in circumcised boys versus 1165 cases in intact boys.
