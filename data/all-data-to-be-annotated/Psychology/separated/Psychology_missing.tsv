"The findings suggest that music instruction helps enhance skills that are critical for academic success.

Although phonological processing improved in both the music training and active control groups, the enhancement was greater in adolescents who underwent music training.

10.1016/j.cub.2011.12.018	Psychology_tweet_220_p	Dog's gaze following tuned to human communicative signals: 	Furthermore, dogs followed the actor's gaze significantly less in the BC compared to the O condition [cumulative accuracy, two-sample t test, t(24) = 22.107, p = 0.045].	Dog's gaze following tuned to human communicative signals: 	Importantly, however, the accuracy indexes calculated for the cueing phase did not capture gaze following in BC [mean 6 SEM of cumulative accuracy: 20.06 6 0.14; one-sample t test, t(12) = 20.433; p = 0.67; first look: 0.11 6 0.16; one-sample t test, t(12) = 0.695; p = 0.5]. Furthermore, dogs followed the actor's gaze significantly less in the BC compared to the O condition [cumulative accuracy, two-sample t test, t(24) = 22.107, p = 0.045]. These data suggest that the lack of gaze following, when there are no ostensive signals, cannot be accounted for by the confounding effect of ''artificial'' salient attention getter used in the NO condition, also providing further support for the significant role of ostensive signals in dogs' gaze response.
