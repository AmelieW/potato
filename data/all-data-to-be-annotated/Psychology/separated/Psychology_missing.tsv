Ritual circumcision among Danish boys is linked to an overall 46-62% increase in ASD risk in the first 10 years of life, with the upper risk estimate obtained after restriction to the period with the most complete data. More strikingly, risk was 80-83% increased in the first 0-4 years of life, an increase that was restricted to infantile autism. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence to suggest a link between circumcision and hyperactivity disorder, so our finding of an increased risk of this common neurobehavioral disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families was unexpected and needs cautious interpretation.

"Also, the likelihood of a pregnancy being unplanned may increase with the number of children a woman already has -- and this brings its own stresses."" Compared to men, women gain more in happiness in expectation of, and right after, the birth of a child. Women also have steeper drops in their happiness than men between the year of the birth and the year afterward, possibly because of the larger initial gain."	These might explain why women anticipate a first birth more than men, with stronger happiness increases prior to and around the birth and a larger drop afterward. A potentially important physiological factor may be the increased levels of the hormone oxytocin during pregnancy and after birth . Qualitative information on work-family conflict, planning status of births, and instrumental support would be useful to further our understanding of the social mechanisms.

Even after controlling for sex, ethnicity, age, parental education, and child physical abuse, childhood corporal punishment was associated significantly with physical dating violence perpetration (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.62).	About 19 percent said they had committed some form of dating violence and 69 percent said they were physically punished during childhood. The study identified a significant association between corporal punishment during childhood and violence toward dating partners in adulthood. Specifically, people who got spanked as kids had a 29 percent higher risk for perpetrating dating violence, the findings showed.	Analysis showed a significant positive association between corporal punishment and physical perpetration of dating violence (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.59).

A mediation analysis showed that these functional connectivities underlie the association of the Depressive Problems score with poor sleep quality (β = 0.0139; P < .001).	In the brains of those living with depressive problems, they discovered a strong connection between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with short-term memory), the precuneus (associated with the self), and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (associated with negative emotion). The analysis showed that these functional connectivities underlie the relation between depressive problems and sleep quality. The researchers conclude that increased functional connectivity among these brain regions provides a neural basis for how depression is related to poor sleep quality.	The brain areas with increased functional connectivity associated with both sleep and Depressive Problems scores included the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, temporal cortex, and precuneus.

Although labels appear to also influence intensity ratings and reaction times, this seems to be a more complex relationship that could be modulated by additional factors such as odor valence, label fit, and possibly the edibility attributed to an odor or a label.	When associated with a pleasant label, we enjoy the odour more than when it is presented with a negative label. The result was that all participants rated the four odours more positively when they were presented with positive labels than when presented with negative labels. Specifically, participants described the odours as pleasant and edible (even those associated with non-food items) when associated with positive labels.	In summary, odor labels affect pleasantness ratings and edibility perception. Although labels appear to also influence intensity ratings and reaction times, this seems to be a more complex relationship that could be modulated by additional factors such as odor valence, label fit, and possibly the edibility attributed to an odor or a label. Odors with different valences impact our mood and wellbeing in different ways.

Beckley, who is in the department of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, said the adult-onset group had a history of anti-social behavior back to childhood, but reported committing relatively fewer crimes. This group reported committing more crimes than folks who had never been convicted, but fewer crimes than people who had been in trouble as juveniles.	Our results, along with past research (see, for example, , indicate that as a whole, apparent adult-onset offenders are responsible for a small minority of total crime. Our results showed that most of the official adult-onset men began their antisocial activities during early childhood. In fact, on average, official adult-onset men were similar to juvenile-onset men on multiple measures of child and adolescent antisocial behavior.

Immune dysfunction in autism. Pathophysiological pathways. 	Furthermore, these dysfunctional immune responses are associated with increased impairments in behaviors characteristic of core features of ASD, in particular, deficits in social interactions and communication. This review will discuss the current state of our knowledge of immune dysfunction in ASD, how these findings may impact on underlying neuro-immune mechanisms and implicate potential areas where the manipulation of the immune response could have an impact on behavior and immunity in ASD. There is a concordance rate for ASD of 0-37% reported for dizygotic twins, while concordance rates of 44-91% are reported for monozygotic twins (Bailey et al., 1995; Constantino and Todd, 2000; Kates et al., 2004; Steffenburg et al., 1989) , suggesting that genetic composition may contribute to increased risk of developing ASD.
