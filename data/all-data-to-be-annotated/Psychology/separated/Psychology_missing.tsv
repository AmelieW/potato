10.1177/0141076814565942	Psychology_43_p	The researchers also made the observation of an increased risk of hyperactivity disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families.	Risk in this age group was markedly elevated among boys in non-Muslim families (HR ¼ 4.23; 95% CI: 1.90-9.44), a finding based on six ASD cases in circumcised boys versus 1165 cases in intact boys.	They found that regardless of cultural background circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing ASD. The researchers also made the observation of an increased risk of hyperactivity disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families. Risk was particularly high for infantile autism before the age of five, at least in epidemiology.	The increased risk of ASD in circumcised boys under the age of 5 years was present among boys in both Muslim and non-Muslim families ( Table 2) . Risk in this age group was markedly elevated among boys in non-Muslim families (HR ¼ 4.23; 95% CI: 1.90-9.44), a finding based on six ASD cases in circumcised boys versus 1165 cases in intact boys. Among boys in Muslim families, ASD risk was also significantly elevated in those who were circumcised (HR ¼ 1.54; 95% CI: 1.03-2.31), based on 28 ASD cases in circumcised boys versus 160 cases in intact boys.
