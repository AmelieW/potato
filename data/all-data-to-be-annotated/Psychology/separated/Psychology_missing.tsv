10.1177/1745691615617439	Psychology_426_p	The Big Five personality dimensions show about 40-60 percent heritability rates, indicating that a sizeable portion of personality appears to be determined by genetic factors.	Heritability estimates for behavioral traits, typically between 30% and 50%, are by far the largest effect sizes in psychological science.	Of interest, concordance rates for identical twins reared apart were similar to those of identical twins raised together, suggesting the environmental influence was based on unshared environmental variables. The Big Five personality dimensions show about 40-60 percent heritability rates, indicating that a sizeable portion of personality appears to be determined by genetic factors. This area of study is complex and beyond the scope of this article, but the field is quickly progressing.	The most important reason for the reproducibility of behavioral genetic results is that genetic effect sizes are large. Heritability estimates for behavioral traits, typically between 30% and 50%, are by far the largest effect sizes in psychological science. In retrospect, it is amazing that inherited DNA differences can work their way through the complexities of pathways from genes to brain to behavior and end up accounting for so much of the variance of complex psychological traits.

Our results showed that most of the official adult-onset men began their antisocial activities during early childhood.	Using this unusually rich source of data, the study was able to look at childhood history compared with adult behavior. Beckley, who is in the department of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, said the adult-onset group had a history of anti-social behavior back to childhood, but reported committing relatively fewer crimes. This group reported committing more crimes than folks who had never been convicted, but fewer crimes than people who had been in trouble as juveniles.	Our results, along with past research (see, for example, , indicate that as a whole, apparent adult-onset offenders are responsible for a small minority of total crime. Our results showed that most of the official adult-onset men began their antisocial activities during early childhood. In fact, on average, official adult-onset men were similar to juvenile-onset men on multiple measures of child and adolescent antisocial behavior.

Immune dysfunction in autism. Pathophysiological pathways. 	Furthermore, these dysfunctional immune responses are associated with increased impairments in behaviors characteristic of core features of ASD, in particular, deficits in social interactions and communication. This review will discuss the current state of our knowledge of immune dysfunction in ASD, how these findings may impact on underlying neuro-immune mechanisms and implicate potential areas where the manipulation of the immune response could have an impact on behavior and immunity in ASD. There is a concordance rate for ASD of 0-37% reported for dizygotic twins, while concordance rates of 44-91% are reported for monozygotic twins (Bailey et al., 1995; Constantino and Todd, 2000; Kates et al., 2004; Steffenburg et al., 1989) , suggesting that genetic composition may contribute to increased risk of developing ASD.
