10.1177/0141076814565942	Psychology_11_p	The researchers noted they also made an unexpected observation of an increased risk of hyperactivity disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families.	To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence to suggest a link between circumcision and hyperactivity disorder, so our finding of an increased risk of this common neurobehavioral disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families was unexpected and needs cautious interpretation.	The study's findings showed that, regardless of cultural background, circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing ASD. The researchers noted they also made an unexpected observation of an increased risk of hyperactivity disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families. While it is unacceptable today to circumcise boys without proper pain relief, there is no way to eliminate the pain completely, the researchers said, adding that some boys will endure a lot of pain.	More strikingly, risk was 80-83% increased in the first 0-4 years of life, an increase that was restricted to infantile autism. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence to suggest a link between circumcision and hyperactivity disorder, so our finding of an increased risk of this common neurobehavioral disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families was unexpected and needs cautious interpretation. As expected, risk of asthma was independent of the boys' foreskin status, which is in accordance with prior findings for asthma in the first years of life.

Immune dysfunction in autism. Pathophysiological pathways. 	Furthermore, these dysfunctional immune responses are associated with increased impairments in behaviors characteristic of core features of ASD, in particular, deficits in social interactions and communication. This review will discuss the current state of our knowledge of immune dysfunction in ASD, how these findings may impact on underlying neuro-immune mechanisms and implicate potential areas where the manipulation of the immune response could have an impact on behavior and immunity in ASD. There is a concordance rate for ASD of 0-37% reported for dizygotic twins, while concordance rates of 44-91% are reported for monozygotic twins (Bailey et al., 1995; Constantino and Todd, 2000; Kates et al., 2004; Steffenburg et al., 1989) , suggesting that genetic composition may contribute to increased risk of developing ASD.

Dog's gaze following tuned to human communicative signals: 	Importantly, however, the accuracy indexes calculated for the cueing phase did not capture gaze following in BC [mean 6 SEM of cumulative accuracy: 20.06 6 0.14; one-sample t test, t(12) = 20.433; p = 0.67; first look: 0.11 6 0.16; one-sample t test, t(12) = 0.695; p = 0.5]. Furthermore, dogs followed the actor's gaze significantly less in the BC compared to the O condition [cumulative accuracy, two-sample t test, t(24) = 22.107, p = 0.045]. These data suggest that the lack of gaze following, when there are no ostensive signals, cannot be accounted for by the confounding effect of ''artificial'' salient attention getter used in the NO condition, also providing further support for the significant role of ostensive signals in dogs' gaze response.
