Our results invite further investigation into the neurobiological mechanisms in ADHD that produce delays in development of large-scale networks.	"The findings are also relevant to thinking about the longitudinal course of ADHD from childhood to adulthood. Future studies of brain network maturation in ADHD could shed light into the neural basis for this difference.

Our results provide strong initial evidence that these alterations arise from delays in typical maturational patterns. Our results invite further investigation into the neurobiological mechanisms in ADHD that produce delays in development of large-scale networks. We found significant and specific maturational lag in connections within default mode network (DMN) and in DMN interconnections with two task positive networks (TPNs): frontoparietal network and ventral attention network.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Tic disorders, including TS and CTDs, cluster in families primarily because of genetic factors and appear to be among the most heritable neuropsychiatric conditions.	Risk for #tic disorders, including #Tourette syndrome, increased w/ degree of #genetic relatedness. 	There were no differences in familial risk or heritability between male and female patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Tic disorders, including TS and CTDs, cluster in families primarily because of genetic factors and appear to be among the most heritable neuropsychiatric conditions. Second, families were primarily recruited from specialist clinics, potentially resulting in the inclusion of more severe and impaired cases.

10.1177/1948550616660592	Psychology_439	For instance, people with low cognitive ability tended to express prejudice towards groups perceived as liberal and unconventional, such as atheists, gays, and lesbians, as well as groups of people perceived as having low choice over group membership, such as ethnic minorities.	This implies that there is a similar psychological mechanism for people higher and lower in cognitive ability, such as the effects of attitude dissimilarity or in-group/ out-group distinctions on prejudice .	Analyzing the results, the researchers found that people with both relatively higher and lower levels of cognitive ability show approximately equal levels of intergroup bias, but towards different groups. For instance, people with low cognitive ability tended to express prejudice towards groups perceived as liberal and unconventional, such as atheists, gays, and lesbians, as well as groups of people perceived as having low choice over group membership, such as ethnic minorities. People with high cognitive ability showed the reverse pattern, according to the study's findings.	Second, positive and negative correlations are consistent with a ''crossover interaction,'' where people both lower and higher in cognitive ability express intergroup bias, but toward different sets of groups. This implies that there is a similar psychological mechanism for people higher and lower in cognitive ability, such as the effects of attitude dissimilarity or in-group/ out-group distinctions on prejudice . Similar comprehensive knowledge-based tests had the strongest associations with prejudice in past research compared to other types of measures .
