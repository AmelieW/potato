Risk in this age group was markedly elevated among boys in non-Muslim families (HR ¼ 4.23; 95% CI: 1.90-9.44), a finding based on six ASD cases in circumcised boys versus 1165 cases in intact boys.	They found that regardless of cultural background circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing ASD. The researchers also made the observation of an increased risk of hyperactivity disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families. Risk was particularly high for infantile autism before the age of five, at least in epidemiology.	The increased risk of ASD in circumcised boys under the age of 5 years was present among boys in both Muslim and non-Muslim families ( Table 2) .

Although labels appear to also influence intensity ratings and reaction times, this seems to be a more complex relationship that could be modulated by additional factors such as odor valence, label fit, and possibly the edibility attributed to an odor or a label.	When associated with a pleasant label, we enjoy the odour more than when it is presented with a negative label. The result was that all participants rated the four odours more positively when they were presented with positive labels than when presented with negative labels. Specifically, participants described the odours as pleasant and edible (even those associated with non-food items) when associated with positive labels.	In summary, odor labels affect pleasantness ratings and edibility perception. Although labels appear to also influence intensity ratings and reaction times, this seems to be a more complex relationship that could be modulated by additional factors such as odor valence, label fit, and possibly the edibility attributed to an odor or a label. Odors with different valences impact our mood and wellbeing in different ways.

Although labels appear to also influence intensity ratings and reaction times, this seems to be a more complex relationship that could be modulated by additional factors such as odor valence, label fit, and possibly the edibility attributed to an odor or a label.	When associated with a pleasant label, we enjoy the odour more than when it is presented with a negative label. The result was that all participants rated the four odours more positively when they were presented with positive labels than when presented with negative labels. Specifically, participants described the odours as pleasant and edible (even those associated with non-food items) when associated with positive labels.	In summary, odor labels affect pleasantness ratings and edibility perception. Although labels appear to also influence intensity ratings and reaction times, this seems to be a more complex relationship that could be modulated by additional factors such as odor valence, label fit, and possibly the edibility attributed to an odor or a label.

Immune dysfunction in autism. Pathophysiological pathways. 	Furthermore, these dysfunctional immune responses are associated with increased impairments in behaviors characteristic of core features of ASD, in particular, deficits in social interactions and communication. This review will discuss the current state of our knowledge of immune dysfunction in ASD, how these findings may impact on underlying neuro-immune mechanisms and implicate potential areas where the manipulation of the immune response could have an impact on behavior and immunity in ASD.
