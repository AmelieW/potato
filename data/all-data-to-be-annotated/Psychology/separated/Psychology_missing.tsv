"Regardless of background, the team explains, ""circumcised boys were more likely than intact boys to develop ASD before age 10 years.""

Ritual circumcision among Danish boys is linked to an overall 46-62% increase in ASD risk in the first 10 years of life, with the upper risk estimate obtained after restriction to the period with the most complete data. More strikingly, risk was 80-83% increased in the first 0-4 years of life, an increase that was restricted to infantile autism. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence to suggest a link between circumcision and hyperactivity disorder, so our finding of an increased risk of this common neurobehavioral disorder among circumcised boys in non-Muslim families was unexpected and needs cautious interpretation.

The findings provide valuable insight into understanding the functional makeup of a vital neural network that is critical for characterizing the social symptoms in individuals with ASD.	Functional connectivity analyses revealed underconnectivity between frontal and posterior regions during task performance in the ASD participants.

Further, a mediation analysis showed that the functional connectivity links between the brain areas identified played a significant role in the association of depressive problems with poor sleep quality.	In the brains of those living with depressive problems, they discovered a strong connection between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with short-term memory), the precuneus (associated with the self), and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (associated with negative emotion). The analysis showed that these functional connectivities underlie the relation between depressive problems and sleep quality. The researchers conclude that increased functional connectivity among these brain regions provides a neural basis for how depression is related to poor sleep quality.	The results show that both poor sleep quality and depressive problems are significantly positively correlated with functional connectivities involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, and the precuneus.

While anyone whoas experienced the difficulty of depression or insomnia may not be surprised that theyare connected, this study marks the first time scientists can definitively say there are neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between the two."	We note that the causal relations between sleep and depression is an important topic that deserves much further investigation. Although previous studies have found changes in patients with depression in some of the regions of interest identified in this study, including the precuneus and angular gyrus, 43 this is to our knowledge the first study to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the associations of depressive problems with sleep quality and to associate sleep quality with functional connectivity in a large sample of participants. A strength of this investigation is that the effects are likely to be very robust, given the large sample of participants with resting-state fMRI and the cross-validation with the UK Biobank data set with a sample of 8718 participants in one of its first uses of resting-state fMRI data.

The result: support from their partners is helpful to smokers who wish to stop and it increases their chances of success, provided that they have developed skills of their own that help them to abstain. Such support could involve their partner reminding them of their plan to quit as well as encouraging and supporting them in critical situations. Careful planning

The same is true of the coping strategies that the smoker plans to apply in difficult situations (for instance, taking a chewing gum or being reminded of one's wish to quit when spending an evening in the company of smokers and feeling an uncontrollable craving for a cigarette)."

The crossover here goes some way to proving that sleep and depression are affected by similar parts of our brains a and suggests it is this link that causes us to feel down and more susceptible to mental health problems when we suffer from a lack of sleep. Jianfeng Feng and Edmund Rolls, who headed up the study, stressed the significance of their conclusions to Sleep Review, with Rolls stating that the results are likely to have ""implications for a deeper understanding of depression,"" as the evidence highlights ""a key brain area that might be targeted in the search for treatments."""	We note that there is a strong association between depression and poor sleep, in that the correlation found in this study between the Depressive Problems score and PSQI score was high (r = 0.371, P <1.0×10 −10 , Figure 1B) ; however, this does not address the directionality of the association, which could be in both directions. Indeed, we note that poor sleep quality also may have an effect on depression, as shown by the mediation analysis. We note that the causal relations between sleep and depression is an important topic that deserves much further investigation.

"	Sympathetic synchrony predicted perceived similarity between partners and this was true regardless of the social or physiological context. That is, sharing similar amounts sympathetic reactivity was sufficient to increase perceptions of similarity regardless of social context and no matter the arousal levels partners shared. Although this finding runs counter to the expectation that physiological synchrony would be most socially meaningful in the context of physiological reactivity, the finding is supported by prior work demonstrating a link between sympathetic synchrony and affiliation among strangers in similarly benign settings .
