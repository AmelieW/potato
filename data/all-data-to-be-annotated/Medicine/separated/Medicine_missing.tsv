In other words, researchers wrote, approximately one in 200 people treated with aspirin would experience significant bleeding. To prevent a single heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death, approximately 250 patients needed to be treated with the drug for five years.	However, the use of cardiovascular risk scores tends to overestimate an individual's true risk, 32 with poor agreement between different cardiovascular risk calculators. 6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0.51% (5% CI, 0.06%-0.3%) for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of 0.64% (5% CI, 0.35%-0.7%) for major bleeding. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.

The results show that most fundamental Arctic infrastructure will be at risk, even if the Paris Agreement target is achieved. Results show that by 2050 3.6 million people, which constitutes about three quarters of the current population in the Northern Hemisphere permafrost area, may be affected by damage to infrastructure associated with permafrost thaw (Fig. 2a , Supplementary  Tables 2 and 3 , Supplementary Data 1) (results for 2061-2080 are presented in Supplementary Fig.	[4.0, 5.0, 4.0]	Medicine	train	4.333333333333333	news	http://ct.moreover.com/?a=37952323296&p=1pl&v=1&x=YZkcSHKHdqhjfYYiUvZ_gw	"['<span id=""hover_text_paper"" data-toggle=""tooltip"" data-html=""true"" data-placement=""bottom"" title=""Context: The results show that most fundamental Arctic infrastructure will be at risk, even if the Paris Agreement target is achieved.

Drug Delivers Estrogen Selectively to the Brain to Treat Neurological Disorders #SciTM  via @username @username	Although this method provides increased selectivity in CNS delivery of the hormone, it still generates elevated levels of the hormone in the periphery with substantial uterotrophic side effects and sustained high circulating estrogen levels even after acute dosing . We reveal the therapeutic potential of DHED on estrogen deficiency-associated neurological disorders and psychiatric conditions without encountering adverse systemic actions that are typically seen with the direct use of estrogens. The reductive bioactivation of DHED to E 2 proceeds through hydride transfer from the coenzyme NADPH to the C1 position of the C1-C2 double bond of DHED's Aring that is conjugated to the 3-carbonyl group.
