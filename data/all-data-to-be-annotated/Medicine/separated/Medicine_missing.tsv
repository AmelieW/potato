Cost-effectiveness of #hpv #vaccines: 	Because of interstate migration and the long duration between HPV infection and resultant cervical cancer, much of the benefit of vaccination will be realized beyond a state's borders. Therefore, both cervical cancer incidence and expenditure can be substantially reduced if the states coordinate policies to promote expansion of coverage, particularly for the new nonavalent vaccine.
