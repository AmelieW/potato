Amygdala encodes subjective judgment of emotions shown in face stimuli, rather than simply their stimulus features: 	We found 3 out of 24 (12.5%) fear-selective cells and 5 out of 17 (29.4%) happyselective cells are also whole-face-selective, a ratio of whole-face cells similar to that found in the entire population (36 out of 185, 19.5%). This suggests that amygdala neurons encode whole-face information and emotion independently. We found that face information conveyed by the eyes, but not the mouth region, modulated emotion-selective neuronal responses.

Association of Prenatal Exposure to Air Pollution With Autism  and some media:  It's complicated: 	Findings In this population-based cohort study of 132 256 births, maternal exposure to nitric oxide during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in offspring. Meaning Reducing exposures of pregnant women to environmental nitric oxide may be associated with a reduction in autism spectrum disorder incidence in their children. The use of LUR models provides greater spatial resolution and the ability to capture small-scale, localized variation compared with reliance on air-quality monitoring data alone.
