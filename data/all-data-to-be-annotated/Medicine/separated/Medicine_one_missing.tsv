Cohort effects were also observed for some subgroups, particularly in $7 hours of sleep for male subjects, white subjects, and those in urban areas; those in the earliest cohorts, as well as cohorts born in the early 1990s, were more likely to report regular $7 hours of sleep compared with all other adolescents.	Despite the fact that the recommended amount of sleep for adolescents is nine hours, students from lower-income families and ethnic minorities did not report having more than seven hours of sleep a night. While the reasons for the difference in sleep times is unclear, it could be due to housing quality, obesity, and conditions that disrupt sleep, as well as worrying about money, of course. Interestingly, the study also found that students from middle and higher-income families who had parents that received a high school education regularly had more than seven hours of sleep per night.	Thus, these data indicate that adolescent sleep is declining across all age groups and major sociodemographic subgroups.

The researchers found that 58 percent of nurses gave their hospitals an unfavorable evaluation of end-of-life care overall and 53 percent reported that patients often experience painful procedures that were unlikely to change their outcome. The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care. Compared to nurses in poor-quality environments, nurses in the best environments were less likely to rate their hospital's overall end-of-life care quality unfavorably (odds ratio, 0.45).	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment.

The scientists thought that the obese dogs would be more likely to wait for the potential high-value meal, that they would do anything for something big and tasty. However, that was not the case.	Our results also confirm that overweight dogs, as opposed to normal weight dogs, tried to maximize food intake from the higher quality food and hesitated to do the task when the food reward was uncertain.

We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure.	Led by Hollis Woodard, an assistant professor of entomology, the team found that exposure to a widely used insecticide and a poor diet negatively impacted bumblebee queens' health and work, which could have dramatic consequences on an already dwindling pollinator group. They showed bumblebee queens were far less active and six times more likely to die during sustained exposure (37 days) to the pesticide, which could be somewhat mitigated by a shorter exposure of 17 days. The surviving exposed bees also produced only a third of the eggs and a fourth of the larvae of untreated queens.	Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure. The effects of pollen diet on individual queen-and colony-level responses were overshadowed by effects of the insecticide, although a monofloral pollen diet alone was sufficient to negatively impact brood production.
