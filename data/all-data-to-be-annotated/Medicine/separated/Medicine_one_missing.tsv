The researchers found that 58 percent of nurses gave their hospitals an unfavorable evaluation of end-of-life care overall and 53 percent reported that patients often experience painful procedures that were unlikely to change their outcome. The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care. Compared to nurses in poor-quality environments, nurses in the best environments were less likely to rate their hospital's overall end-of-life care quality unfavorably (odds ratio, 0.45).	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment.

Now, findings from Monell reveal that a person's sensitivity to bitter taste is shaped not only by which taste genes that person has, but also by how much messenger RNA -- the gene's instruction guide that tells a taste cell to build a specific receptor - their cells make. The findings add a new level of complexity to the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of taste perception, which may ultimately lend insight into individual differences in food preferences and dietary choices.	intensity, it was not combined with gene expression in a final model. We provide the first experimental evidence that mRNA expression amounts of the PAV allele of the TAS2R38 taste receptor gene correlate with sensory perception of bitterness and with dietary habits in humans. PAV-TAS2R38 expression was detected in the majority of PAV/AVI heterozygotes (61%), with substantial variation in expression that related to variations in psychophysical perception of known TAS2R38 ligands PROP and broccoli juice: the greater the gene expression, the greater the ratings of bitterness.

The results indicate that nasal microbiota has a role in the presentation of viral upper respiratory illness symptoms.	The study team found that the baseline nasal microbiota samples divided into six types named after predominant bacterial genera: (1) Staphylococcus, (2) Corynebacterium/Alloiococcus, (3) Moraxella, (4) Haemophilus, (5) Pseudomonadaceae/Mixed, and (6) Mixed. Each nasal microbiota type had a characteristic inflammatory response and viral load profile. In general, subjects having Staphyloccocus, and Corynebacterium/Alloiococcus types had lower inflammatory responses and Pseudomonadaceae/Mixed type had lower viral load than other types.	The individual symptoms sneezing, plugged nose, and cough followed a similar pattern. The results indicate that nasal microbiota has a role in the presentation of viral upper respiratory illness symptoms. It has been shown that the severity of illness is modestly correlated with the innate inflammatory CXCL8 and CXCL10 response to the virus 33 , however the nasal lavage concentrations of these cytokines were similar between the clusters.
