Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality. Low vitamin D level status during pregnancy may expose the offspring to a suboptimal nutritional environment during critical phases of fetal development and may have long-term effects on offspring health outcomes.""><b>Finding C:</b></span> Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.<br><span id=""hover_text_news"" data-toggle=""tooltip"" data-html=""true"" data-placement=""bottom"" title=""Context: In the context of drug delivery, this platform is considered \'drug-agnostic,\' which simply means the same membrane technology can be used for a wide spectrum of drugs, and just the size of the channel is what needs to be customized.

Importantly, chemical inhibition and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of NLRP3 in primary human macrophages reduced IL-1B production in response to CLCs, suggesting that the inflammatory response occurs via the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.
