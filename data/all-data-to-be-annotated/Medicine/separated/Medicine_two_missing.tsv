One factor that merits additional attention is the association between a youth's history of experiencing corporal punishment and perpetration of dating violence.	About 19 percent said they had committed some form of dating violence and 69 percent said they were physically punished during childhood. The study identified a significant association between corporal punishment during childhood and violence toward dating partners in adulthood. Specifically, people who got spanked as kids had a 29 percent higher risk for perpetrating dating violence, the findings showed.	9 These factors cut across various domains including affective (eg, emotion dysregulation, psychiatric disorder), cognitive (eg, attitudes toward women, beliefs about violence), demographic (eg, age, race, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status), interpersonal (eg, relationship satisfaction, problem solving skills), contextual (eg, availability of weapon, drug/alcohol use), as well as distal factors (eg, history of child abuse, exposure to family violence). One factor that merits additional attention is the association between a youth's history of experiencing corporal punishment and perpetration of dating violence. Attaining a better understanding of antecedents of dating violence is critical for preventive strategies seeking to mitigate dating violence among youth.

Women with below average HRV were significantly more likely to report sexual arousal dysfunction (p \ .001) and overall sexual dysfunction (p \ .001) than both women with average HRV and women with above average HRV.
