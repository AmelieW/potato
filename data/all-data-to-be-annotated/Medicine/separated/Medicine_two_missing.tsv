10.1111/jgs.15671	Medicine_72_p	The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care.	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment.	The researchers found that 58 percent of nurses gave their hospitals an unfavorable evaluation of end-of-life care overall and 53 percent reported that patients often experience painful procedures that were unlikely to change their outcome. The nurse practice environment was the best predictor of poor-quality end-of-life care. Compared to nurses in poor-quality environments, nurses in the best environments were less likely to rate their hospital's overall end-of-life care quality unfavorably (odds ratio, 0.45).	The best predictor of poor quality was the nurse practice environment. Nurses in the best environments were 55% less likely than nurses in poor environments to rate their hospital's overall end-oflife care quality unfavorably (odds ratio = 0.45; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.52; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Quality of end-of-life care in US hospitals is imperfect and is significantly worse in hospitals with poor nurse practice environments than in hospitals with the best environments.

A new study on dog behavior may help us better understand how human personalities affect obesity. The scientists thought that the obese dogs would be more likely to wait for the potential high-value meal, that they would do anything for something big and tasty. However, that was not the case.	Our results also confirm that overweight dogs, as opposed to normal weight dogs, tried to maximize food intake from the higher quality food and hesitated to do the task when the food reward was uncertain. These results are very similar to those expected from the parallel models that exist between certain personality traits and being overweight in humans, suggesting that dogs are indeed a promising model for experimentally investigating obesity in humans. Dogs, due to their shared living environment with humans, may provide a beneficial model to study the causes and consequences of obesity.

This study is the first direct demonstration of liana effects at the ecosystem scale and illustrates the important role of lianas in tropical forests, particularly with respect to carbon budgets.	The researchers found that study plots with lianas accumulated 76 percent less biomass over the experimental period due to reduced tree growth and increased tree death. Extrapolating their results to tropical forests as a whole, the team calculated that lianas could potentially reduce long-term storage of carbon in tropical forests by one-third or more. The study will be useful in guiding scientists working to predict the trajectory of carbon storage as atmospheric concentrations rise, and it may help explain recent observations that the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests is declining.	By impacting on tree growth and survival, lianas impact the carbon balance of these forests. This study is the first direct demonstration of liana effects at the ecosystem scale and illustrates the important role of lianas in tropical forests, particularly with respect to carbon budgets.
