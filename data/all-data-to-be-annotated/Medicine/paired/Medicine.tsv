It is important to note that obtaining a linear release profile for a molecule carrying a charge of sign opposite to that of the channel surfaces is trivial: as a matter of fact, it is a previously unreported achievement.	In the context of drug delivery, this platform is considered 'drug-agnostic,' which simply means the same membrane technology can be used for a wide spectrum of drugs, and just the size of the channel is what needs to be customized.

Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.	At higher doses, any differences between women who took vitamin D and those who didn't were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance. Taking vitamin D during pregnancy was safe, with no extra fetal or neonatal mortality, congenital abnormality, or critical illness at birth, said senior author Dr. Shu Qin Wei of the University of Montreal, Canada. And supplementation reduced infants' risk of being small for gestational age and improved their calcium levels and growth in the first 12 months of life.	CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of SGA and improved infant growth without risk of fetal or neonatal mortality or congenital abnormality. Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality. Low vitamin D level status during pregnancy may expose the offspring to a suboptimal nutritional environment during critical phases of fetal development and may have long-term effects on offspring health outcomes.

Compared to those who didn't take aspirin, aspirin use was associated with a 43 percent increase of major bleeding events. In other words, researchers wrote, approximately one in 200 people treated with aspirin would experience significant bleeding. To prevent a single heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death, approximately 250 patients needed to be treated with the drug for five years.	However, the use of cardiovascular risk scores tends to overestimate an individual's true risk, 32 with poor agreement between different cardiovascular risk calculators. 6 This study showed that when analysis was restricted to populations with observation-derived 10-year cardiovascular event rate estimates of 10% or more, aspirin use was associated with an absolute risk decrease of 0.51% (5% CI, 0.06%-0.3%) for the cardiovascular composite outcome, but an absolute risk increase of 0.64% (5% CI, 0.35%-0.7%) for major bleeding. The current study demonstrates that the absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events and absolute risk increase for major bleeding associated with aspirin use were of similar magnitude.

We then analyze the patterns for different socioeconomic groups and parities and show that the changes in subjective well-being over the transition to parenthood are highly consistent with the low and late fertility behavior that has emerged during the second demographic transition: older parents and those with more socioeconomic resources have the strongest happiness gains around the time of birth, and the temporary happiness gain around the time of birth declines with the number of children that one already has.	"In addition, the data reveals that a reaction to a birth is highly influenced by such sociodemographic characteristics as age or socioeconomic status. ""Those who become parents at young ages have a downward happiness trajectory, but those who become parents at older ages and men with more resources have more positive short- and long-term responses to a birth,"" the scientists claim. This fact can also in part explain why mean age of parents has increased."	Importantly, we observe that happiness increases before birth, suggesting that the happiness gain around the time of birth may capture not only the effect of the birth but also the complex childbearing process that may involve partnership formation, partnership quality, and increased sexual activity. We then analyze the patterns for different socioeconomic groups and parities and show that the changes in subjective well-being over the transition to parenthood are highly consistent with the low and late fertility behavior that has emerged during the second demographic transition: older parents and those with more socioeconomic resources have the strongest happiness gains around the time of birth, and the temporary happiness gain around the time of birth declines with the number of children that one already has.

One factor that merits additional attention is the association between a youth's history of experiencing corporal punishment and perpetration of dating violence.	About 19 percent said they had committed some form of dating violence and 69 percent said they were physically punished during childhood. The study identified a significant association between corporal punishment during childhood and violence toward dating partners in adulthood. Specifically, people who got spanked as kids had a 29 percent higher risk for perpetrating dating violence, the findings showed.	9 These factors cut across various domains including affective (eg, emotion dysregulation, psychiatric disorder), cognitive (eg, attitudes toward women, beliefs about violence), demographic (eg, age, race, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status), interpersonal (eg, relationship satisfaction, problem solving skills), contextual (eg, availability of weapon, drug/alcohol use), as well as distal factors (eg, history of child abuse, exposure to family violence). One factor that merits additional attention is the association between a youth's history of experiencing corporal punishment and perpetration of dating violence. Attaining a better understanding of antecedents of dating violence is critical for preventive strategies seeking to mitigate dating violence among youth.

The results indicate that nasal microbiota has a role in the presentation of viral upper respiratory illness symptoms.	The study team found that the baseline nasal microbiota samples divided into six types named after predominant bacterial genera: (1) Staphylococcus, (2) Corynebacterium/Alloiococcus, (3) Moraxella, (4) Haemophilus, (5) Pseudomonadaceae/Mixed, and (6) Mixed. Each nasal microbiota type had a characteristic inflammatory response and viral load profile. In general, subjects having Staphyloccocus, and Corynebacterium/Alloiococcus types had lower inflammatory responses and Pseudomonadaceae/Mixed type had lower viral load than other types.	The individual symptoms sneezing, plugged nose, and cough followed a similar pattern. The results indicate that nasal microbiota has a role in the presentation of viral upper respiratory illness symptoms. It has been shown that the severity of illness is modestly correlated with the innate inflammatory CXCL8 and CXCL10 response to the virus 33 , however the nasal lavage concentrations of these cytokines were similar between the clusters.

We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure.	Led by Hollis Woodard, an assistant professor of entomology, the team found that exposure to a widely used insecticide and a poor diet negatively impacted bumblebee queens' health and work, which could have dramatic consequences on an already dwindling pollinator group. They showed bumblebee queens were far less active and six times more likely to die during sustained exposure (37 days) to the pesticide, which could be somewhat mitigated by a shorter exposure of 17 days. The surviving exposed bees also produced only a third of the eggs and a fourth of the larvae of untreated queens.	Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure. The effects of pollen diet on individual queen-and colony-level responses were overshadowed by effects of the insecticide, although a monofloral pollen diet alone was sufficient to negatively impact brood production.
