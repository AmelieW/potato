Health literacy is a relevant factor to consider for optimizing the postoperative recovery in patients undergoing day surgery.	Poorer postoperative recovery in patients with lower functional health literacy! 	CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Inadequate FHL in patients undergoing day surgery was associated with poorer postoperative recovery and a lower health-related quality of life. Health literacy is a relevant factor to consider for optimizing the postoperative recovery in patients undergoing day surgery. 6 Considering this, the association between FHL and postoperative recovery in patients undergoing day surgery needs to be assessed.

We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure.	Led by Hollis Woodard, an assistant professor of entomology, the team found that exposure to a widely used insecticide and a poor diet negatively impacted bumblebee queens' health and work, which could have dramatic consequences on an already dwindling pollinator group. They showed bumblebee queens were far less active and six times more likely to die during sustained exposure (37 days) to the pesticide, which could be somewhat mitigated by a shorter exposure of 17 days. The surviving exposed bees also produced only a third of the eggs and a fourth of the larvae of untreated queens.	Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure.

"On evenings when using light-emitting tablets, participants' self-selected bedtimes were on average half an hour later, and they showed suppressed melatonin levels, delayed timing of melatonin secretion onset, and later sleep onset.

The third site, with a lower binding affinity, allows the calcium ions to move into the cell."	This pore architecture suggests a conduction pathway involving transitions between two main states with one or two hydrated Ca 21 ions bound in the selectivity filter and supports a 'knock-off' mechanism of ion permeation through a stepwisebinding process.

The third site, with a lower binding affinity, allows the calcium ions to move into the cell. The flow of ions is accelerated by having these three binding sites in sequence."	Our results reveal interactions of hydrated Ca 21 with two high-affinity Ca 21 -binding sites followed by a third lower-affinity site that would coordinate Ca 21 as it moves inward. This pore architecture suggests a conduction pathway involving transitions between two main states with one or two hydrated Ca 21 ions bound in the selectivity filter and supports a 'knock-off' mechanism of ion permeation through a stepwisebinding process. The multi-ion selectivity filter of our Ca V Ab model establishes a structural framework for understanding the mechanisms of ion selectivity and conductance by vertebrate Ca V channels.
