Health literacy is a relevant factor to consider for optimizing the postoperative recovery in patients undergoing day surgery.	Poorer postoperative recovery in patients with lower functional health literacy!

Health literacy is a relevant factor to consider for optimizing the postoperative recovery in patients undergoing day surgery. 6 Considering this, the association between FHL and postoperative recovery in patients undergoing day surgery needs to be assessed.

Despite these potential limitations, the present study extends the available evidence for the role of cortisol on clinical pregnancy in IVF patients and provides the first evidence that elevated chronic cortisol levels are associated with a reduced likelihood of pregnancy.	"The research follows an earlier study which suggested that elevated long-term levels of cortisol may reduce the likelihood of a successful outcome for patients trying to conceive by IVF. However, many factors influence cortisol (including physical activity, sleep and some aspects of our diet such as caffeine) and so it is possible that any or all of these factors may account for the effects of cortisol on pregnancy."" If this is proven with further solid research it may modify our approach to pre-IVF testing in all patients."	It is also not clear how generalizable our results are to women trying to conceive naturally; also our findings extend only to clinical pregnancy. Despite these potential limitations, the present study extends the available evidence for the role of cortisol on clinical pregnancy in IVF patients and provides the first evidence that elevated chronic cortisol levels are associated with a reduced likelihood of pregnancy. Thus, further research is needed to not only corroborate these findings but also identify the pathways.

The seasonal patterns of prevalence and loads of P. destructans were remarkably consistent for all six bat species, with a sharp increase in prevalence between autumn and early winter when bats began to hibernate and a peak in fungal load in late winter at the end of hibernation.	The researchers were surprised to discover that during the winter, when the bats are hibernating, the fungus can infect nearly every bat in a colony. Bats that survive the winter are able to clear the infection during summer when their body temperatures are above the growth limit of the fungus. But the remarkably high rate of infection during hibernation leads to high mortality rates at the time of year when bat populations are naturally at their lowest, before the females give birth in the summer.	Decreases in loads and prevalence over the summer did not parallel changes in colony size for M. lucifugus, which broadly overlapped and The seasonal patterns of prevalence and loads of P. destructans were remarkably consistent for all six bat species, with a sharp increase in prevalence between autumn and early winter when bats began to hibernate and a peak in fungal load in late winter at the end of hibernation. In contrast to many other systems , we found no support for the hypothesis that birth pulses drive seasonality.

The result: support from their partners is helpful to smokers who wish to stop and it increases their chances of success, provided that they have developed skills of their own that help them to abstain.

The same is true of the coping strategies that the smoker plans to apply in difficult situations (for instance, taking a chewing gum or being reminded of one's wish to quit when spending an evening in the company of smokers and feeling an uncontrollable craving for a cigarette)."
