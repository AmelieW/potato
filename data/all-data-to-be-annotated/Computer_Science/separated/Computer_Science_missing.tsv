Facebook's gender divide  cool stuff by @username @username	The FGD has a value below zero when women tend to be more active on Facebook that men, a value close to zero for equal activity tendencies, and a positive value when men are more active on Facebook than women in a country.

Our approach led to gains of roughly 40 to 70%, on average, in refugees' employment outcomes relative to current assignment practices.	In 2016 alone, about 65.6 million people were forced to flee their homes. The algorithm assigned placements for refugees that they project would increase their chances of finding employment by roughly 40 to 70 percent compared with how the refugees actually fared, according to the new study in Science. The group, from Stanford and ETH Zurich, says the algorithm, which could be implemented at virtually no cost, could help resource-constrained governments and resettlement agencies find the best places for refugees to relocate.	Our approach led to gains of roughly 40 to 70%, on average, in refugees' employment outcomes relative to current assignment practices.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.06.031	Computer_Science_409_r	Changes in communication between the brain's cortical areas could also be related to cognitive impairments correlated with cannabis use.	A decrease in posterior network degree and an increase in the clustering coefficient in frontal regions suggests changes in long-range communications that allow for corticocortical interactions between networks and may be related to cognitive impairments associated with cannabis use.	Prashad said this could signify that participants had difficulty inhibiting neural activity that has been observed in Dr. Filbey's previous studies, which would cause them to exert more effort as they attempted to stop doing certain tasks. Changes in communication between the brain's cortical areas could also be related to cognitive impairments correlated with cannabis use. The findings of this research suggest that further studies are needed during task-related activity for comparison, Prashad said.	This loss of neural refinement indicates a noisy brain and an impairment in inhibiting ongoing neural activity that may interrupt cognitive processing. A decrease in posterior network degree and an increase in the clustering coefficient in frontal regions suggests changes in long-range communications that allow for corticocortical interactions between networks and may be related to cognitive impairments associated with cannabis use. Significant correlations were found between cannabis use measures and spectral power and functional connectivity, highlighting electrophysiological signals as relevant neural associations that may be essential in examining effects related to cannabis use.
