First, using different image bands in the hyperspectral cube, plants can be more accurately segmented from the background and leaves can be accurately distinguished from stems (which is quite challenging with a RGB or NIR image). Second, hyperspectral images are capably of capturing the full spectral signature of plants, allowing more advanced analytical tools such as PLSR for modeling of leaf biochemical properties. Based on these previous knowledges, hyperspectral imaging is suggested as a powerful tool in plant phenotyping to complement RGB analysis (to obtain plant chemical traits in addition to morphological traits).

The new model built on these assumptions accurately predicts the effect of end-to-end latency on user error rate for the task.	This cognitive model is capable of predicting the success rate of a user when there is latency in a 'moving target selection' task which requires button input in a time constrained situation. The model predicts the players' task success rate when latency is added to the gaming environment. In fact, this research succeeded in modifying the pillar heights of the Flappy Bird game, allowing the players to maintain their gaming performance regardless of the added latency.	For a moving-target selection task with zero latency, a model for predicting the user's error rate already exists . The new model built on these assumptions accurately predicts the effect of end-to-end latency on user error rate for the task. When geometric compensation is applied, the model can predict the corresponding error rate, thereby facilitating control of game difficulty level when latency exists.

The distinct nature of these hashtags makes it likely that there are geographic differences in their use.	The study is the first large-scale analysis of fear and social-support reactions from geographically distant communities following a terrorist attack. The findings show the extent to which communities outside of Boston expressed their emotions by using hashtags such as #PrayForBoston and how those reactions correlated with geographic proximity, social-network connections, and direct ties to Boston. The full results of the study, which have been published online in the journal EPJ Data Science, may provide insight to governmental agencies exploring how to best handle public fear following a disruptive event.	This analysis thus confirms that the two hashtags, when used independently, were used to convey different meanings. The distinct nature of these hashtags makes it likely that there are geographic differences in their use.

A decrease in posterior network degree and an increase in the clustering coefficient in frontal regions suggests changes in long-range communications that allow for corticocortical interactions between networks and may be related to cognitive impairments associated with cannabis use.	Prashad said this could signify that participants had difficulty inhibiting neural activity that has been observed in Dr. Filbey's previous studies, which would cause them to exert more effort as they attempted to stop doing certain tasks.
