Finally, professionals in the Western region of the United States were less accepting of mobile phone use during meetings.	Similarly, 50 percent of men said it was acceptable to answer a call at a power lunch, compared to 26 percent of women. Despite the casual reputation, professionals from the West Coast were less accepting of mobile phone use in meetings than people from the East Coast. Higher-income professionals had less tolerance for smartphone use in business meetings.	Also, higher-income professionals showed lower acceptance for mobile phone use during meetings. Finally, professionals in the Western region of the United States were less accepting of mobile phone use during meetings. In the informal meeting setting (see Model 2 in Table 5 ), the following variables were significant predictors: age, gender, and region.

It is important to isolate the factors that are important for learning in mixed-reality environments.	A game that combined real-world experiments with interactions on a computer tablet improved learning by almost five times more than screen-only alternatives. The final analysis shows that the mixed-reality game improved learning by almost five times more than the screen-only alternatives, both in the mouse-controlled and physically controlled conditions. Not only that, but students enjoyed the game more in the mixed-reality conditions.	Since creating such affordances in the real world is technically challenging, it is tempting to hope that integrating easier-to-develop physical controls into a screen-based environment may improve enjoyment and learning just as well. It is important to isolate the factors that are important for learning in mixed-reality environments. Piaget and Bruner showed that children had an easier time while solving problems when given concrete materials to work .
