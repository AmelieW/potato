Interesting approach for targeting food inspections 	We used this information to focus restaurant inspections in two cities and demonstrated that FINDER improves the accuracy of health inspections; restaurants identified by FINDER are 3.1 times as likely to be deemed unsafe during the inspection as restaurants identified by existing methods. Additionally, FINDER enables us to ascertain previously intractable epidemiological information, for example, in 38% of cases the restaurant potentially causing food poisoning was not the last one visited, which may explain the lower precision of complaint-based inspections. We found that FINDER is able to reliably identify restaurants that have an active lapse in food safety, allowing for implementation of corrective actions that would prevent the potential spread of foodborne illness.

This failure to find an association between hippocampal volume and navigational expertise thus suggests that structural differences in the hippocampus of taxi drivers reflect the detail and/or duration of the use of the spatial representation acquired and not innate navigational expertise per se.

The distinct nature of these hashtags makes it likely that there are geographic differences in their use.	The study is the first large-scale analysis of fear and social-support reactions from geographically distant communities following a terrorist attack. The findings show the extent to which communities outside of Boston expressed their emotions by using hashtags such as #PrayForBoston and how those reactions correlated with geographic proximity, social-network connections, and direct ties to Boston. The full results of the study, which have been published online in the journal EPJ Data Science, may provide insight to governmental agencies exploring how to best handle public fear following a disruptive event.	This analysis thus confirms that the two hashtags, when used independently, were used to convey different meanings. The distinct nature of these hashtags makes it likely that there are geographic differences in their use.

A game that combined real-world experiments with interactions on a computer tablet improved learning by almost five times more than screen-only alternatives. The final analysis shows that the mixed-reality game improved learning by almost five times more than the screen-only alternatives, both in the mouse-controlled and physically controlled conditions. Not only that, but students enjoyed the game more in the mixed-reality conditions.	The overall results (including both the prediction and explanation items) indicated that there was a significant effect of media-type (F(1,91)=8.2, p<0.01, d=0.37). The overall improvement from pre to post was 11.3 % in the mixed-reality conditions and 2.4 % in the virtual conditions.

The ordinary second law just corresponds to the non-increasing of one of these free energies, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions.	In a sense, the traditional second law only holds on average. Surprisingly, the researchers found that not only does the second law hold at such small scales, but there are actually many other second laws at work. In other words, just like larger systems, small systems also tend to become more disordered.	In particular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law just corresponds to the non-increasing of one of these free energies, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions.
