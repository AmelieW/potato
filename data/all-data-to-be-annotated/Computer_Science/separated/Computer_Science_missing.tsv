10.1089/cyber.2013.0658	Computer_Science_413_p	The study found significant positive correlations between video-game guilt and the moral foundations violated during game play.	These results provide strong convergent and discriminant validity for the potential that playing an immoral character in a video game leads to an increased salience of content-relevant intuitions mediated by the moral emotion of guilt.	"Grizzard explains that in life and in game, specific definitions of moral behavior in each domain will vary from culture to culture and situation to situation. advertisement

""For instance,"" he says, ""an American who played a violent game 'as a terrorist' would likely consider his avatar's unjust and violent behavior -- violations of the fairness/reciprocity and harm/care domains -- to be more immoral than when he or she performed the same acts in the role of a 'UN peacekeeper.'"" The study found significant positive correlations between video-game guilt and the moral foundations violated during game play."	All other models fail to meet the a priori determined criteria. These results provide strong convergent and discriminant validity for the potential that playing an immoral character in a video game leads to an increased salience of content-relevant intuitions mediated by the moral emotion of guilt. Furthermore, by utilizing random assignment and a sequential model, the findings provide evidence of causation.

'Physical observation + interactive feedback improved children’s learning by 5x' via Nesra Yannier @username 	There was no effect of control type and no interaction effects. These results show that mixed-reality led to more learning than screen only, for both the mousecontrol and physical-control conditions ( Figure 10 ). We can consider what choice improves learning most over a typical virtual, mouse-control game (#1 in Figure 10 ).
