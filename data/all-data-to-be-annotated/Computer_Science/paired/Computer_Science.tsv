10.1177/1080569913501862	Computer_Science_70	A timely new study co-authored by Peter W. Cardon of the USC Marshall School of Business and colleagues at Howard University is the first to provide an empirical baseline for how attitudes towards mobile phone use actually break down across gender, age and region.	Showing these figures and tables can also foster productive conversations about how generation, gender, and status affect perceptions of appropriate mobile phone use in formal and informal settings.	But unlike rudeness among friends, discourteous behavior in the workplace can have real implications for careers, hiring and even workplace efficiency, with tension among coworkers harming productivity. A timely new study co-authored by Peter W. Cardon of the USC Marshall School of Business and colleagues at Howard University is the first to provide an empirical baseline for how attitudes towards mobile phone use actually break down across gender, age and region. Published today in the journal Business Communication Quarterly, the research offers a critical baseline for how attitudes toward technology may change over time and serves as a guide to navigating social expectations around polite smartphone use.	It also equips instructors and trainers with a current set of statistics about norms of civility associated with various mobile phone behaviors in formal and informal meetings. Business communication instructors and trainers can use the tables and figures in this article to help business students and professionals gain awareness of some of the dramatic generational and gender differences. Showing these figures and tables can also foster productive conversations about how generation, gender, and status affect perceptions of appropriate mobile phone use in formal and informal settings.

Second, hyperspectral images are capably of capturing the full spectral signature of plants, allowing more advanced analytical tools such as PLSR for modeling of leaf biochemical properties.	"The system can rapidly measure and compare the physical traits, or phenotypes, of different crop varieties by transporting plants through several 360-degree imaging chambers. The crop's unwieldy size and complex anatomy have left it mostly ignored by previous automated phenotyping work, the researchers said. We were fairly successful in doing that."""	First, using different image bands in the hyperspectral cube, plants can be more accurately segmented from the background and leaves can be accurately distinguished from stems (which is quite challenging with a RGB or NIR image). Second, hyperspectral images are capably of capturing the full spectral signature of plants, allowing more advanced analytical tools such as PLSR for modeling of leaf biochemical properties. Based on these previous knowledges, hyperspectral imaging is suggested as a powerful tool in plant phenotyping to complement RGB analysis (to obtain plant chemical traits in addition to morphological traits).

Interesting approach for targeting food inspections 	We used this information to focus restaurant inspections in two cities and demonstrated that FINDER improves the accuracy of health inspections; restaurants identified by FINDER are 3.1 times as likely to be deemed unsafe during the inspection as restaurants identified by existing methods. Additionally, FINDER enables us to ascertain previously intractable epidemiological information, for example, in 38% of cases the restaurant potentially causing food poisoning was not the last one visited, which may explain the lower precision of complaint-based inspections.

We prove that constant-depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their classical counterparts.	Because they have such short coherence time before the system becomes chaotic and useless for any computations, you can only perform a relatively small number of operations on them. In this paper, the researchers prove that a quantum computer with a fixed circuit depth is able to outperform a classical computer that's tackling the same problem because the classical computer will require the circuit depth to grow larger, while it can stay constant for the quantum computer. There is very little that's intuitive about quantum computing, of course, but it's worth remembering that quantum computers are very different from classical computers.	We prove that constant-depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their classical counterparts. We prove that any classical probabilistic circuit composed of bounded fan-in gates that solves the 2D Hidden Linear Function problem with high probability must have depth logarithmic in n. In contrast, we show that this problem can be solved with certainty by a constant-depth quantum circuit composed of one-and two-qubit gates acting locally on a two-dimensional grid.

The myth of cognitive decline. This has certainly received a lot of press in the last 24 hrs.  (free access for now)	Given that the models run (and can be rerun) on computers, the possibility that any differences in their performance are due to aging hardware can be eliminated; instead, their patterns of performance reflect the information-processing costs that must inevitably be incurred as knowledge is acquired. Once the cost of processing this extra information is controlled for in studies of human performance, findings that are usually taken to suggest declining cognitive capacities can be seen instead to support little more than the unsurprising idea that choosing between or recalling items becomes more difficult as their numbers increase.

Once the cost of processing this extra information is controlled for in studies of human performance, findings that are usually taken to suggest declining cognitive capacities can be seen instead to support little more than the unsurprising idea that choosing between or recalling items becomes more difficult as their numbers increase.

10.1073/pnas.1411728112	Computer_Science_340	Surprisingly, the researchers found that not only does the second law hold at such small scales, but there are actually many other second laws at work.	The ordinary second law just corresponds to the non-increasing of one of these free energies, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions.	In a sense, the traditional second law only holds on average. Surprisingly, the researchers found that not only does the second law hold at such small scales, but there are actually many other second laws at work. In other words, just like larger systems, small systems also tend to become more disordered.	In particular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law just corresponds to the non-increasing of one of these free energies, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. We further find that there are three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.06.031	Computer_Science_409	Changes in communication between the brain's cortical areas could also be related to cognitive impairments correlated with cannabis use.	A decrease in posterior network degree and an increase in the clustering coefficient in frontal regions suggests changes in long-range communications that allow for corticocortical interactions between networks and may be related to cognitive impairments associated with cannabis use.	Prashad said this could signify that participants had difficulty inhibiting neural activity that has been observed in Dr. Filbey's previous studies, which would cause them to exert more effort as they attempted to stop doing certain tasks. Changes in communication between the brain's cortical areas could also be related to cognitive impairments correlated with cannabis use. The findings of this research suggest that further studies are needed during task-related activity for comparison, Prashad said.	This loss of neural refinement indicates a noisy brain and an impairment in inhibiting ongoing neural activity that may interrupt cognitive processing. A decrease in posterior network degree and an increase in the clustering coefficient in frontal regions suggests changes in long-range communications that allow for corticocortical interactions between networks and may be related to cognitive impairments associated with cannabis use. Significant correlations were found between cannabis use measures and spectral power and functional connectivity, highlighting electrophysiological signals as relevant neural associations that may be essential in examining effects related to cannabis use.
