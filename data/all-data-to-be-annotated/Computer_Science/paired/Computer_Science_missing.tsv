Neural circuitry constrains the space of possible activity patterns during learning  via @username	However, animals were less able to learn to proficiently control the cursor using activity patterns that were outside of the intrinsic manifold. These results suggest that the existing structure of a network can shape learning. On a timescale of hours, it seems to be difficult to learn to generate neural activity patterns that are not consistent with the existing network structure.

Cardon of the USC Marshall School of Business and colleagues at Howard University is the first to provide an empirical baseline for how attitudes towards mobile phone use actually break down across gender, age and region.	Showing these figures and tables can also foster productive conversations about how generation, gender, and status affect perceptions of appropriate mobile phone use in formal and informal settings.	But unlike rudeness among friends, discourteous behavior in the workplace can have real implications for careers, hiring and even workplace efficiency, with tension among coworkers harming productivity. A timely new study co-authored by Peter W. Cardon of the USC Marshall School of Business and colleagues at Howard University is the first to provide an empirical baseline for how attitudes towards mobile phone use actually break down across gender, age and region. Published today in the journal Business Communication Quarterly, the research offers a critical baseline for how attitudes toward technology may change over time and serves as a guide to navigating social expectations around polite smartphone use.	It also equips instructors and trainers with a current set of statistics about norms of civility associated with various mobile phone behaviors in formal and informal meetings. Business communication instructors and trainers can use the tables and figures in this article to help business students and professionals gain awareness of some of the dramatic generational and gender differences.
